Nash put over the impact of his moves in the ring and said he believes he could have had a good match with him in his prime.</p><p>“I didn’t know much about the guy,” Kevin Nash admitted. “And so I watched some clips. And I’ll say he’s a good hand. The one thing, and this is probably the most important thing is he has some high-impact finishing moves or moves. And he really does an excellent job of always, not occasionally, not 90% of the time, but always making sure that he tucks that person’s head and lays them flat. He looks like he’s strong.</p><p>“I always look at it like, okay, could I have a match to this guy in my prime? Hell yeah, he would have laid me flat; I could have had a good match with him. So I wasn’t dogging him. My whole thing was, I don’t think people understood that was the first time that my eyes and what I thought — I never saw him as [Eli Drake], I didn’t see him in NXT.”</p><p>Kevin Nash conceded that if LA Knight is the people’s champion, they should run with it. Nash also apologized for not knowing who he was because he doesn’t watch SmackDown because there is too much wrestling on television on a weekly basis.</p><p>“If LA Knight, if he’s the chosen one if he’s the people’s champion. Then he’s the people’s champion. It doesn’t f**king matter to me,” Kevin Nash said. “If his segments do a number and that f**king helps the WWE, which I’m a stockholder. And it makes my buddy fucking Paul’s [Triple H] life easier then f**k? Get over, dude.</p><p>“It was just one of those things where I don’t want SmackDown. So dude, I didn’t know who the f**k you were, and I apologize. But some of us in professional wrestling actually watch sports, watch film, occasionally read a book. I do other things besides watch wrestling. There’s 394 hours of wrestling on television a week. I just can’t do it.”</p><p><a href=#>LA Knight: If You Say I’m The Kobe To Rock And Austin’s Jordan, I’ll Take It</a></p><p>What do you make of Kevin Nash’s comments?
