Back in April, she brought her girl gang back together for a bestie dinner in New York City, and a few months after that, she hosted her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>first Fourth of July party in seven years</a>, where everyone from BFF Selena Gomez and all three members of Haim were in attendance.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Meanwhile, just last night, Taylor had a girls' night out with longtime squad member <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Blake Lively</a> at Zero Bond in Manhattan's Noho neighborhood. During the outing, each showcased their distinct personal style, with Taylor going schoolcore chic in a charcoal gray pleated miniskirt, a black cardigan, and maroon leather knee-high boots, while Blake stuck with her signature style move and mixed multiple patterns. The actress paired a denim shirt that featured a colorful patchwork lining with a printed T-shirt, a tweed miniskirt, and tartan pumps.&nbsp;<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Splash News</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Their outfits might've been polar opposite, but Blake and Taylor's glam was totally in synch. Both girls wore their long, blonde hair down in loose, beach-y waves while also sporting a bold red lip. Taylor added a swipe of winged liner to her beauty look, while Blake, on the other hand, opted for bronzy eyeshadow instead.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Splash News</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Earlier in the day, Swift was seemingly hanging out with her other BFF, Selena Gomez.&nbsp;Over on Instagram, Selena shared a set of images of the besties posing for selfies together while dining outdoors. "Thas my best frien — she a real bad," Gomez wrote in the caption, quoting the lyrics from Saweetie's song "Best Friend," featuring Doja Cat.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK5705qwpaeiYsC4tcWtZJukkaCybrjIr5ylsV2owbq4yKyfZp%2BZp7m0ec2inqGsXaTCtXmWcm5pcGZt</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./savannah-chase-chrisley-joke-about-crazy-childhood-photos.html><span>←</span><span>Savannah, Chase Chrisley Joke About Crazy Childhood Photos</span></a>
