The hitmaker decided to share a list of the perks that come along with dating him, letting all of his followers know what he brings to the table. "Dating me is fun," his post reads. "You get a comedian, mental patient, and a pornstar all in one."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">His post has gotten mixed reactions from fans, who are sounding off in The Neighborhood Talk's comments section. While some users think it sounds like a <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">pretty sweet deal</a>, others wish he would have kept this one to himself. "He too grown to be posting stuff like this. Grow up Christopher," one commenter writes. "I hate when he post like that," another says.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-chris-brown-reveals-some-perks-of-dating-him>Chris Brown Reveals Some Perks Of Dating Him</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Of course, commenters are also out in full force with jokes about some of the less flattering attributes he left off the list. Regardless, fans are glad to see him come through with a lighthearted post, considering some of his recent heated rants. Earlier this month, for example, he went off about mainstream media and "fake" celebrity peers on his Instagram Story. In the post, he made it abundantly clear that <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">he's not out for others' approval.</a></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"I DONT WANT TO BE ACCEPTED FROM NONE OF THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA AND FAKE CELEBRITIES," he wrote. "I AM KING IN MY OWN LANE. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">YOUR FAVE AINT GOT SH*T ON ME</a> AND THEY KNOW IT. AINT FINNA TAP DANCE FOR APPROVAL. YOU WILL BEG FORGIVENESS OF ME THAT I DO KNOW." What do you think of Chris Brown claiming that dating him is like dating a pornstar?
