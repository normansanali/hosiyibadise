She also said that she made a pact with partner Butterworth that they would introduce her girls to their music.&nbsp;</p><p>“We just didn’t want to be listening to the Little Mermaid on a loop for four hours.” She continued that they didn’t want the girls to know what kids’ music was.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Dora The Explorer And Harry Potter</h2><p>While the actress doesn’t want her daughters to be introduced to much of kids’ music, kids’ shows seem to be an exception.
