While the judges initially planned to only take three finalists to New York Fashion Week, they decided they wanted to see shows from all of them. What's more, it became the first time in Project Runway history that all of the finalists were female.</p><p>The judges were joined by guest designer Tommy Hilfiger for the Season 19 finale. The final four contestants ‚Äî Chasity Sereal, Coral Castillo, Kristina Kharlashkina, and Shantall Lacayo ‚Äî gave it their all, and the judges had amazing things to say about each of them.

Although each of the designers showed up and showed out in the finale, it was Shantall who wowed with her sustainability-centric collection called "Herencia" ("Heritage"), which drew inspiration from the Aztec feathered-serpent deity Quetzalcoatl.</p><p>"I‚Äôve dreamed about this moment for so long," Shantall said in reaction to her win. "It‚Äôs not just about me winning this competition. It‚Äôs about my family winning this competition. I can‚Äôt believe it."</p><p>She went on to share that throughout her career, she's always received negative feedback for her looks being "too colorful, too Latin, too loud." All she's ever wanted is to be recognized for who she is as an artist, and now that day has finally come.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>ALL THE FEELS right now! üò≠üñ§ <a href=#>#ProjectRunway</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/XRHbro8BAn</a></p>‚Äî Bravo (@BravoTV) <a href=#>February 4, 2022</a> <span>Source: Twitter / @Bravo</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Many ‚ÄòProject Runway‚Äô viewers wanted Chasity to be the winner.</h2><p>As with any competition show, it's safe to say that some fans won't be happy with the results. Ahead of the Project Runway Season 19 finale, many viewers took to social media to show their support for fan favorite Chasity Sereal. Although Chasity received her fair share of criticism during the season, many fans have been rooting for her to win it in the end.</p><p>One Project Runway fan <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a>, ‚ÄúChasity literally has me at home crying. I‚Äôm so happy and proud of her. I love that I get to see a Black woman like her on my TV.‚Äù</p><p>And fans weren't the only ones who fell in love with the designer. In the finale, Tommy asked Chasity about her plans for the future. She told the world-renowned businessman that she plans on creating an international brand and ‚Äúhelping the next generation.‚Äù However, Tommy had suggestions of his own.</p><p>‚ÄúI think you‚Äôre missing one thing ‚Äî making costumes for the stars,‚Äù he told Chasity. ‚ÄúIf Beyonc√©, if [Jennifer Lopez], if Ariana Grande, all of these top performers could see this, you would have orders.‚Äù</p><p>How do you feel about the winner?
