(I want what she has!) The supermodel was photographed walking her dog in sunny, warm Florida&nbsp;— which makes sense given what she was wearing — looking ultra-angelic (and comfy) in her two-piece outfit. The ‘fit doesn’t quite seem suitable for right now, especially if you’re in colder regions, but I will be wearing it nonstop come June.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bündchen’s all-white look consisted of a lightweight batwing-sleeve tunic top that flowed in the wind. It was slightly sheer and appeared to be designed from that classic gauze fabric your beach coverup is probably made out of, too. She paired the outfit with similarly <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">low-key white linen pants</a> with subtle slits at the hem. They featured an elastic waist for optimum comfort, while the slits gave the bottoms some more flow. She finished off the look with flip-flops (yes, really!), and sunglasses.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-tommy-bahama-two-palms-high-waist-linen-pants></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Tommy Bahama Two Palms High-Waist Linen Pants</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-sea-level-sunset-beach-high-waist-cotton-gauze-cover-up-pants></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Sea Level Sunset Beach High-Waist Cotton Gauze Cover-Up Pants</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The supermodel’s all-white look had me itching for summer and especially ready to pull out my billowy, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">white linen pants again</a>. Right now, I’ve been living in thick sweatpants, and rightly so — it’s still cold, and whenever I go on my Central Park mental health walk, my legs freeze when I’m wearing anything other than heavy-duty sweats.
