She revealed that she is not straight. She has told the world about her conversation with her NHL player husband Brooks Laich. An article on her has been published in the recent issue of Women Health magazine.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Julianne-Hough-and-Brooks-Laich-1.jpg><p>Julianne revealed that she was frightened initially to tell her husband Brooks about it. She felt that he may not understand and reject her. She told the magazine:</p><p>“I was connecting to the woman inside that doesn’t need anything, versus the little girl that looked to him to protect me. I was like, ‘Is he going to love this version of me?’ But the more I dropped into my most authentic self, the more attracted he was to me.”</p><p>She gathered courage and told him. And this is how their conversation went. Julianne said:</p><p>“I [told him], ‘You know I’m not straight, right?’ And he was like, ‘I’m sorry what?’ I was like, ‘I’m not. But I choose to be with you. I think there’s a safety with my husband now that I’m unpacking all of this, and there’s no fear of voicing things that I’ve been afraid to admit or that I’ve had shame or guilt about because of what I’ve been told or how I was raised.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_reaction_of_Brooks_Laich_and_her_brother_Derek_Hough></span>The reaction of Brooks Laich and her brother Derek Hough<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Julianne was not sure of what her close ones would feel about her sexuality and the truth of it. But they have been extremely supportive as revealed by their Instagram posts. Her loving husband Brooks praised her for coming out. He wrote on his Instagram after her article was published:</p><p>“So proud of my wife @juleshough for the woman she is, and her courage to share her journey of trials and triumphs!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Julianne-Hough-and-Brooks-Laich-e1491874400700.jpg><p>The revelation has only brought the couple close. Similarly, her dancer brother <a href=#>Derek Hough</a> was all praise for his sister. He too took to Instagram to support his sister and her coming out.
