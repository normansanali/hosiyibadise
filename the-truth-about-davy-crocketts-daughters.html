We do know that she survived frontier life long enough to marry Wiley Flowers, with whom she would raise three children. Even the date of her death is unclear; it took place sometime between 1854-60.</p><p>With his first wife deceased, and single parent to three children, including an infant, David sought to remarry as quickly as possible. Most people consider his second marriage, to Elizabeth Patton, a marriage of convenience. She had money, and he most assuredly did not; she was organized, and he wasn't. For her part, she was a widow with two children of her own. And David was popular.</p><p>After their marriage in 1815, the couple, with their blended family, produced two more daughters. The first, Rebecca, in 1818, lived until 1879. She married twice: to George Kimbrough and James Halford. She had two children, a daughter and a son. David's third daughter (the second with Elizabeth) was Matilda, born in 1821. She lived until 1890 and had three husbands of her own: Redden Fields, Thomas D Tyson, and James Wilson. She had one child, a daughter. It's Matilda who gives us the image of Crockett's coonskin cap: She said he was wearing it when he left to ride off toward Texas, according to <a href=#>Mental Floss</a>. It was the last time she would ever see her father.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9mHBnbnFfqbWmedOrrK2gXZavsMHTZpuarqlisLO7wqScrayjYrGiwcahq56qo2Q%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./raquel-cassidy-bio-wiki-age-height-family-husband-and-net-worth-2.html><span>←</span><span>Raquel Cassidy Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Family, Husband and Net Worth.</span></a>
