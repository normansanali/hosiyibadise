The talented star split from her boyfriend <strong>Riley King</strong> in June, after dating for two years, and released a statement about the relationship status change during an interview. “For the most part, it was great,” she told<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;PEOPLE</a>&nbsp;during an appearance at&nbsp;Billboard&nbsp;Country Live. “People date to see if they’re gonna go the distance, and we weren’t. We just simply were not right for each other, and that’s the bottom line. I am on such a beautiful journey, and I am really excited about the next chapter of my life.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-11>Riley also confirmed the split with a statement. “Yes, things didn’t work out,” he told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Page Six&nbsp;</a>on Wednesday, June 7. “Carly and I have parted ways and I wish her nothing but the best in both her career and personal life.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e5BwZpyZoqHGbrzEmqmcnV2brq240mamp2Wjqa6osYyvoJ2dn2K%2Fpq3Crapo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brad-pitt-dedicates-oscars-2020-win-to-children.html><span>←</span><span>Brad Pitt Dedicates His Oscar to His Children in Winning Speech</span></a>
