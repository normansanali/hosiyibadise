Most notably, Pac took aim at friend turned rival <a href=# rel>Notorious B.I.G.. </a>Pac's bombastic takedown of all things East Coast earned many fans and detractors alike. Moreover, the song has gone down as one of the most indelible tracks of both the decade and hip history. Indeed, It speaks to the track's longevity that it still gets play to this day. However, Snoop now admits that he wasn't a fan of the track.</p><p>Snoop recently sat down with Big Boy TV to discuss his relationship with Tupac. During the conversation, Snoop recalled being shot at while visiting New York. Despite this, he would later express an interest in working in New York artists after the incident. Snoop revealed that this angered Pac. "I&nbsp;went and did an interview and was asked how did I feel about <a href=# rel>Puffy </a>and Biggie. I was like, ‘I like them n-ggas, I wanna do some music with ’em,'" he said. "And that just rubbed cuz the wrong way, like, ‘N-gga, fuck them n-ggas, them n-ggas tried to kill me. N-ggas shot at you, and you talking about you wanna do a song with them n-ggas?"</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-snoop-dogg-angered-tupac-by-wanting-to-work-with-new-york-artists><a href=# class=text-word>Snoop Dogg</a> Angered Tupac By Wanting To Work With New York Artists</h2></span><p>Furthermore, tension had already been growing between the <a href=# rel>East Coast and West Coast </a>at the time. "Hit 'Em Up" only made that tension worse. Subsequently, Snoop voiced his disapproval of the track. “Even when he played the video for me to ‘Hit ‘Em Up,’ even when he played ‘Hit ‘Em Up,’ the song, I didn’t like the song,”&nbsp;he said. "Like, you buying more problems, cuh. You buying problems. Gangstas is everywhere. They make ’em everywhere.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Snoop also spoke on his relationship with Pac in the weeks leading up to Pac's death. Snoop revealed that the relationship with his Death Row Label mate was unpredictable and could change quickly. &nbsp;"I’d say a week before he died, we was best of friends," he said. "Two days before he died, I don’t think he liked me,”&nbsp;<a href=# rel>Tupac was killed</a> in Las Vegas in September of 1996. Additionally, Notorious B.I.G. was murdered the following March. Subsequently, many have speculated that increasing hostility in hip-hop may have played a role in the two legends' untimely deaths.</p><p>[<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Via</a>]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdmaoZzg5Zmqqenn6V6pbvGoGSrnaaarq2%2FjKGcZq%2BRqLu1ecBmnZqmXaSzbrTIrWSepV2qvQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nvidia-geforce-800m-lineup-battery-boost.html><span>←</span><span>NVIDIAs GeForce 800M Lineup for Laptops and Battery Boost</span></a>
