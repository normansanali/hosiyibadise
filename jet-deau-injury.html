Put another way, the fountain is shooting out water at a speed of 124 miles per hour.</p><p>The young man, believed to be in his 20s, reportedly crossed the barriers that surround the fountain. For some reason, he then attempted to put his face on the nozzle from which the water was pumped, only to be thrown backward.</p><p>Not to be deterred, the young man approached a second time — this time trying to wrap his arms around the fountain and quickly being thrown up into the air by the force of the water.</p><p>He came crashing down on the concrete walkway nearby, then, to the surprise of passers-by, dove into Lake Geneva before local authorities came by to take him to the hospital.</p><p>“Police officers came and asked to urgently shut off the Jet d’Eau to be able to go get him,” one witness said.</p><p>The Swiss electric company that runs and operates the fountain, SIG, said it will be filing a complaint against the man for trespassing.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-449719 alt="Jet At Night" width=900 height=599 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/jet-deau-at-night.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-449719 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>The Jet d’Eau has been in operation for more than 130 years, and it is one of the largest fountains in the world.</span></p><p>The Jet d’Eau, which literally translates to “water jet,” has been a staple of the Geneva skyline since the 19th century — and has been one of the city’s most famous landmarks ever since. According to <a href=# rel=noopener>House of Switzerland</a>, to many, the towering fountain of water stands as a symbol of the city’s ambition and vitality.</p><p>And apparently, it only came about due to a technical issue.</p><p>“It’s a bit of a fluke that there’s a water jet in Geneva,” said SIG’s Hervé Guinand.</p><p>Between 1850 and 1890, Geneva’s population boomed from only 64,000 to more than 100,000. As a center of industry and trade, new technology was popping up in Geneva, and these new machines required a significant amount of power.</p><p>To provide power to these new machines, engineers exploited the current of the Rhône River, constructing a hydraulic pump that could use water to power factory machinery — particularly in watchmaking workshops.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-449720 alt="Jet Deau 1886" width=900 height=633 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/jet-deau-1886.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-449720 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>The Jet d’Eau circa 1886.</span></p><p>At night, however, once workers had gone home for the day, excess pressure built up in the system. Engineers initially had to rush to stop each pump individually — until they added a safety valve to control the pressure. The byproduct of this safety valve was a massive fountain of water spraying up into the sky.</p><p>At the time, the water only reached a height of roughly 150 feet. Eventually, engineers worked out a system that no longer required the massive fountain to spray out into the air — but locals and visitors alike had grown rather fond of the fountain’s intermittent spraying.</p><p>The city of Geneva decided to officially establish the jet as a tourist attraction. They also moved it to a more visible spot along the harbor, where it stands to this day.</p><p>Initially, it was only in operation on Sundays and public holidays, but it proved to be so popular that the city began to turn it on occasionally on weekdays. The problem was that it drew its water from the public drinking water system.</p><p>Then, in 1951, it was modified again, propelling water higher into the air and pulling directly from the lake, where it would pass through a filtration system before being shot up into the air.</p><p>The same pumps have been in use ever since, though the city has made some additional enhancements to the fountain, including an LED projector box that can light up the fountain with a variety of colors.</p><p>After reading about this strange incident and learning the history of the Jet d’Eau, read about the time a <a href=#>Belgian mayor’s heart</a> was found inside a jar in a fountain. Then, read about a monument that’s said to be even more dangerous: <a href=#>Kindlifresserbrunnen</a>, a supposed child-eating statue in Bern.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyrsdNmm56ZpWK2r7bUq7A%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-shaun-ts-husband-in-his-workout-videos.html><span>←</span><span>Is Shaun Ts husband in his workout videos?</span></a>
