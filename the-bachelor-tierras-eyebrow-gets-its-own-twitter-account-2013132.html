In fact, the much talked-about contestant on this season of ABC's hit dating show is being memorialized online — in the form of <a href=#>a Twitter account </a>dedicated exclusively to her oft-arched right eyebrow (her calmer left eyebrow does not currently have its own separate Twitter handle).</p><p>The hilarious account, aptly named @TierrasEyebrow, has been making pun-filled comments since its first tweet earlier on in the season. It presently has more than 19,000 followers.</p><p>"It didn't feel too good getting plucked out of the house like that," the anonymous user wrote on Tuesday, Feb. 12. Even former Bachelorette runner-up <strong>Arie Luyendyk </strong>got in on the fun, tweeting at Tierra's uncontrollable brow.</p><p>"Men love me" ..24 and a whole lot to learn," he <a href=#>wrote on Monday, Feb. 11</a>. When another account, @TierrasSparkle, responded to his comment, he gamely shot back his own remark.</p><p>"So @TierrasSparkle is now tweeting me.. I'm concerned. I just now got over @TierrasEyebrow," he wrote jokingly.</p><p><a href=#>On this week's episode</a>, the 24-year-old Las Vegas native had the other remaining women in the house up in arms after she accused level-headed <strong>AshLee</strong> of trying to "sabotage" her relationship with bachelor <strong>Sean Lowe</strong>.</p><p>"I hope that when I'm 32 years old I don't have to sit around 20-year-olds gossiping," she sniped at AshLee. She also claimed that the other girls were constantly talking about the Houston native behind her back.</p><p>Later, however, when the pair took their argument to another room where <strong>Catherine</strong> and <strong>Lesley</strong> were lounging, Tierra denied having ever said such a thing, despite the fact that multiple cameras had recorded her accusations.</p><p>"You are rude," AshLee said sternly. "You do not say good morning, and your raised eyebrow…"</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"Raised eyebrow? I cannot help my face," Tierra shot back. "I know in my own skin that I'm not rude. …My parents told me, 'Tierra, you have a sparkle. Do not let those girls take your sparkle away.' If I could walk around with a smile on my face 24/7 I would, but that would be tiring."</p><p>Even Lowe, who eventually decided that he couldn't deal with Tierra's emotional personality, couldn't resist taking a small jab at the ousted bachelorette.</p><p>When former Bachelorette winner Jef Holm jokingly tweeted at him: "Were you hanging out with Tierra & her uncontrollable eyebrow back there?" in reference to a photo Sean had shared, the Dallas hunk replied, "Yeah Tierra left but I wasn't ready to say goodbye to her eyebrow."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuhnV2XrqS0xKWmq2WknrKzvsCsZJ6xlZe%2FsMOMoJytq12ewbR5zrClZqynnsG1sdFmmJybn6q7tXmRaWhsaWNnfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./susan-moonsie-html.html><span>←</span><span>Susan Moonsie - Age, Family, Bio</span></a>
