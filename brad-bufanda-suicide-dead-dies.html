The family would appreciate privacy at this difficult time.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Law enforcement told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TMZ</a> that Brad reportedly jumped off a building in Los Angeles and a transient found his body on the sidewalk at around 1 a.m. Brad reportedly left a suicide note that gave the names of his parents with a “thank you” to the people in his life. Brad played Felix Toombs alongside <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kristen Bell</strong></a>, 37,&nbsp;<strong>Jason Dohring</strong>, 35, and <strong>Ryan Hansen</strong>, 36, on Veronica Mars in seasons 1 and 2. He also co-starred with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Hilary Duff</strong></a>, 30, and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Chad Michael Murray</strong></a>, 36, in the 2004 movie A Cinderella Story. Before his untimely death, Brad made appearances on other shows like Malcolm In The Middle, Co-Ed Confidential,&nbsp;Boston Public, and Days of Our Lives.&nbsp;He was filming the movie Stan the Man when he died, according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>IMDb</a>. This is such a devastating tragedy. Brad will be so missed.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Brad experienced the massive Veronica Mars fanbase first-hand as an actor on the show. In a 2005 interview, Brad gushed about his co-stars. “That is one fun cast/crew,” he told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>MarsInvestigations.net</a>. “Everyone’s really focused on the work. Everyone’s really dedicated. We all just want the show to look good.” The show was shockingly cancelled after season 3, but a movie was released in 2014 following a successful&nbsp;Kickstarter campaign. He also noted that the highlight of his career was&nbsp;working with <strong>Foxy Brown</strong>, 39, on MTV’s&nbsp;<i>Duets.</i>&nbsp;Brad had a YouTube channel titled EinsteinEnt. He had not posted a video since 2012.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The actor moved to Los Angeles to pursue a full-time film career after graduating high school in 2001. He loved to play basketball and was a fitness practitioner, according to his IMDb biography. He used to train up to 50 hours a week and was a high-level Sauna practitioner at one point.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6><strong>HollywoodLifers</strong>, send your thoughts and prayers to Brad’s family and friends in the comments below.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlnZH5ye49sZpuqkZl6o8HFmqWdmV2owqqvyJ2cZpyVlrFusMieqmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tyre-prices-in-nigeria.html><span>←</span><span>Tyre Prices in Nigeria</span></a>
