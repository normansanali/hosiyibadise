The 2002 Grammys was the last time she's won an award to date. But of course, she was nominated before that win for two songs — once in 1998 and 1999, for the songs "I Get Lonely" and "What's It Gonna Be?!" respectively. In 2001, she was actually nominated in three categories: best female pop vocal performance, best pop vocal album, and best dance recording. She won the latter award for her single, "All For You."</p><p dir=ltr>She was nominated twice in 2004 and once in 2006, but she didn't win anything those years. Despite working on two other albums afterwards — her last, "Unbreakable," in 2015 — those nominations in the early 2000s have been her last — so far. There's no telling if Jackson's newest album, which is expected for release this year (via <a href=#>Retro Pop Magazine</a>), will earn her a nomination after almost 16 years. What's certain? Janet Jackson isn't done creating music.</p><p dir=ltr>A two-part documentary, "Janet," streams on Lifetime and A&E on January 28 (per <a href=#>Harper's Bazaar</a>). The trailer is on <a href=#>YouTube</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunCDkmtubXBfmsOmvthmqqiml2K3orrErWSjmZOgwLC6jLCmp2WRYrSzrcymsGaen6d8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dalen-terry-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-162145-html.html><span>←</span><span>Dalen Terry Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
