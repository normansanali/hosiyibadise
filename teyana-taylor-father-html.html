She started her career as a singer at 15, signing a record deal with&nbsp;Pharrell's Star Trak Entertainment.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Thereon, the multi-hyphenate starred on&nbsp;MTV's reality show&nbsp;My Super Sweet Sixteen, modeled in fashion shows, launched her all-female production company, The Aunties, and churned out hit albums and songs, including her 2014 debut album&nbsp;VII.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Undoubtedly, <a href=# rel=follow>Taylor</a>&nbsp;has remained on top of her game, whether it be as a singer, rapper, choreographer, model, or an all-around businesswoman. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>And,&nbsp;while she has created the best out of her creative abilities, she has one particular person to be grateful for —&nbsp;her mother,&nbsp;Nikki Taylor. Nikki parented Taylor as a single mom and helped her figure out her creative side, even in the absence of her biological father.&nbsp;</p><h2>Who Is Teyana Taylor Father?</h2><p>Taylor's biological father is reportedly Tito Smith. According to her blog in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Urban Newsroom</a>, Taylor's father didn't have much of a role in her upbringing. Smith was apparently too invested in his other eventful romantic relationships.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Besides Taylor, he fathered two sons and a daughter with different women. Taylor, admittedly, was on good terms with all of her dad's baby mamas and her half-siblings, but she couldn't understand how her father could keep having babies when he couldn't even look after the ones he already had.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Probably because of his life choices, Taylor seemingly doesn't have a good relationship with her father. She has never mentioned him in her interviews or even on her socials.&nbsp;</p><h2>Taylor's Mother Helped in Her Career</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Despite the absence of her biological father, Taylor's mother did all she could to raise her well as a single parent in Harlem, New York. And when the 30-year-old found her passion for music at a young age, Nikki helped her perform at parties and sharpen her skills.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>She <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">became her manager</a> and took care of her professional ventures while also supporting her as a mother. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Appreciating the selfless love, Taylor penned a brief, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">heartwarming message</a> for her mother on her birthday that fell on August 19, 2021. The Harlem native&nbsp;posted a picture of her mom and wrote, "! I love you mama always and forever my lady."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><h2>Teyana Taylor Has a Father Figure&nbsp;</h2><p>Although Taylor couldn't have the father-daughter rapport with her biological dad as she may have wanted, she found a father figure in her mother's long-time partner,&nbsp;Boe Daney. Taylor calls Daney her pops.</p><p>On Father's day 2020, she <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">uploaded a picture</a>&nbsp;of herself with Daney on Instagram and wished him in the caption. She penned, "Happy papa day to one of my favorite people in the whole wide world&nbsp;@boemoney_&nbsp;I love you pops!" <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Interestingly, Daney is one member of the Taylormade management group. A peek into his Instagram clarifies he looks after the technical aspects in Taylor's shows. He has actively taken part in Taylor's ongoing&nbsp;The Last Rose Petal Tour, a 12-city farewell for her retirement from music.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKyVrq6vrYytmLKkn6d6p63ToZyrZpipuq0%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sylvia-plath-net-worth-187127.html><span>←</span><span>Sylvia Plath Net Worth</span></a>
