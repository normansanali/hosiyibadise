Murata’s other major work is his illustration of One’s <i>One-Punch Man</i>, serialized in the <i>Weekly Young Jump</i> online version.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=biography></span>Biography<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Murata was born in 1978 in Miyagi Prefecture, Japan. At the age of twelve, he entered a contest to design <i>Mega Man</i> villains and won twice, having final designs adapted from his sketches. The game credits list his name as responsible for Dust Man from <i>Mega Man 4</i> and Crystal Man from <i>Mega Man 5</i>. Murata debuted as a professional manga artist in 1995 by publishing a one-shot titled <i>Partner</i> in a special edition of Shueisha’s <i>Weekly Shōnen Jump</i>. For this work, he received the Hop Step Award. Murata published <i>Samui Hanashi</i> in <i>Weekly Shōnen Jump</i> in June 1998, which won him the Akatsuka Award. In February 2002, he published <i>Kaitō Colt</i> in the same exact magazine.</p><p>When planning was underway to create <i>Eyeshield 21</i>, the editorial department asked Riichiro Inagaki if he wanted to both write and draw the series, but Inagaki felt he was “so rookie”. So Inagaki asked Murata to be the illustrator. In 2002, they published two one-shots called <i>Eyeshield</i> Part 1<span> (<span title="Japanese language text">前編</span>, <i title="Hepburn transliteration">Zenpen</i>)</span> and Part 2<span> (<span title="Japanese language text">後編</span>, <i title="Hepburn transliteration">Kōhen</i>)</span> on March 5 and 12 in <i>Weekly Shōnen Jump</i>.

It is a story about Saitou, a <i>Jump</i> editor based on Murata and Inagaki’s own editor on <i>Eyeshield 21</i>, who decides to become a manga artist and threatens Murata to teach him how to draw manga. A collected volume of the series was released by Shueisha on June 3, 2011. In 2012, Murata posted on Twitter a short story in the same universe in which Saitou pesters the Murata for his manuscript and it was well received for its inventive use of folded paper, cutouts and white-out to create a three-dimensional appearance for his comic.</p><p>Murata wrote and drew a one-shot titled <i>Madofuki Park</i> for the April 2008 issue (published on March 4) of <i>Jump Square</i>, about a futuristic window washer. He also created the one-shot <i>Blust!</i>, centered on a boy who was experimented on and obtained extraordinary powers from eating curry, which was published in April 2009. Murata created yet another one-shot featured in the <i>Weekly Shōnen Jump</i> on June 21, 2010; titled <i>Minds</i>, it was a story about a self-sacrificing soldier during a war, set in the future. Murata also illustrated the <i>Weekly Shōnen Jump</i> 40th anniversary posters, which display the popular manga characters featured in the magazine. Murata served as the artist for <i>Donten Prism Solar Car</i>, which was written by Yasuo Ōtagaki (author of <i>Moonlight Mile</i>) and was published in <i>Jump Square</i> between September 4, 2010 and June 4, 2011. The story of a young man who works at an ironworks and receives the request to build a solar car, it was later published by Shueisha in two volumes.</p><p>In 2012, Murata published two one-shots along with a Japanese web comic author dubbed “One”; the first one, <i>Dotō no Yūshatachi</i>, was released on April 1 in <i>Weekly Young Jump</i>, and the second, <i>Dangan Tenshi Fan Club</i> was released on April 17 in <i>Miracle Jump</i>. Murata started to collaborate with One on the remake of the webcomic <i>One-Punch Man</i>, which started to be serialized in the online version of the <i>Weekly Young Jump</i> on June 14, 2012. Eighteen volumes have been released by Shueisha as of December 4, 2018. An anime adaptation, directed by Shingo Natsume and produced by Madhouse, aired from October 2015 to December 2015.</p><p>In November 2013, Murata was hired to be the character designer for the <i>Majin Bone</i> anime adaptation that began in April 2014. For Square Enix’s magazine <i>Young Gangan</i><span class=nowrap>‘</span>s 10th anniversary issue published on March 20, 2015, Murata did the illustration for One’s <i>Gokiburi Buster</i>, a story about a soldier who is specialized on killing cockroaches. On June 30, 2016, Murata started to publish <i>Mangaka Yashoku Benkyuusho</i> (lit. “Manga Artist’s Late-Night Snack Laboratory”) on Kodansha magazine <i>Morning</i> digital edition. Each chapter features a fictionalized version of Murata preparing dishes, and its 33 chapters have been released into a single volume on December 12, 2016.</p><p>On May 10, 2019 Murata’s father passed away – this information was announced by Yusuke Murata and his brother Kensuke Murata.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=influences-and-style></span>Influences and style<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Murata is a fan of Kinu Nishimura, the character designer of many Capcom video games and Akira Toriyama’s <i>Dragon Ball</i>, with Goku’s battles against Piccolo and Frieza being his favorite moments from the latter. Murata has been highly praised for his art and character designs, including comparisons to Toriyama by June Shimonishi of <i>School Library Journal</i>, as “every inch [is] filled with details and no gag left unseen.” Deb Aoki of About.com praised how Murata’s art give <i>Eyeshield 21</i><span class=nowrap>‘</span>s dynamism, while “he adds lot of clever, hilarious details.” Aoki also said Murata knows “his art not just there to look pretty – it’s there to tell a story.” Mania.com’s Jarred Pine commended the character’s features details and how “strong realistic designs are balanced with some exaggerated ones that add a nice comedic effect.” Murata’s ability to draw from different perspectives and angles was praised by Aoki, Pine, as well as Zac Bertschy and Carlo Santos of Anime News Network. Saying that “it’s difficult to capture the kind of frantic motion every panel exudes in animation,” Bertschy asserted the manga may be better than the anime because of Murata’s art uniqueness. Santos said his capacity of creating imaginative features is not limited to action, praising the singularity of each of the main characters of <i>Eyeshield 21</i>.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=works></span>Works<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li><i>Partner</i><span> (<span title="Japanese language text">パートナー</span>, <i title="Hepburn transliteration">Pātonā</i>)</span> (1995)</li><li><i>Samui Hanashi</i><span> (<span title="Japanese language text">さむいはなし</span>)</span> (1998)</li><li><i>Kaitō Colt</i><span> (<span title="Japanese language text">怪盗COLT</span>)</span> (2002)</li><li><i>Eyeshield 21</i><span> (<span title="Japanese language text">アイシールド21</span>, <i title="Hepburn transliteration">Aishīrudo Nijūichi</i>)</span> (one-shot with Riichiro Inagaki; 2002)</li><li><i>Eyeshield 21</i> (series with Riichiro Inagaki&nbsp;; 2002–2009)</li><li><i>Madofuki Park</i><span> (<span title="Japanese language text">窓ふきパルク</span>, <i title="Hepburn transliteration">Madofuki Paruku</i>)</span> (2008)</li><li><i>Hetappi Manga Kenkyūjo R</i><span> (<span title="Japanese language text">ヘタッピマンガ研究所R</span>)</span> (2008–2010)</li><li><i>Blust!</i> (2009)</li><li><i>Minds</i><span> (<span title="Japanese language text">マインズ</span>, <i title="Hepburn transliteration">Mainzu</i>)</span> (2010)</li><li><i>Donten Prism Solar Car</i><span> (<span title="Japanese language text">曇天・プリズム・ソーラーカー</span>, <i title="Hepburn transliteration">Donten Purizumu Sōrā Kā</i>)</span> (with Yasuo Ōtagaki; 2010–2011)</li><li><i>Dotō no Yūshatachi</i><span> (<span title="Japanese language text">怒涛の勇者達</span>)</span> (with One; 2012)</li><li><i>Dangan Tenshi Fan Club</i><span> (<span title="Japanese language text">弾丸天使ファンクラブ</span>, <i title="Hepburn transliteration">Dangan Tenshi Fan Kurabu</i>)</span> (with One; 2012)</li><li><i>One-Punch Man</i><span> (<span title="Japanese language text">ワンパンマン</span>, <i title="Hepburn transliteration">Wanpanman</i>)</span> (with One; 2012–ongoing)</li><li><i>Gokiburi Buster</i><span> (<span title="Japanese language text">ゴキブリバスター</span>, <i title="Hepburn transliteration">Gokiburi Basutā</i>)</span> (2015)</li><li><i>Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows</i> #4 (manga variant cover; 2015)</li><li><i>Spider-Island</i> #3 (manga variant cover; 2015)</li><li><i>Spider-Verse</i> (Japanese Edition cover; 2016)</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1frsK0wcqeZKatopbBonnBoqagqpGltbp5xZqarWWTlr%2BmsdFmmLCZopnAbrrErWSwp6KptW6tzZ1kpaGWmnq0wM6rsGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./xander-berkeley.html><span>←</span><span>Xander Berkeley</span></a>
