<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Random &amp;amp; Sequential Read/Write Speed</h1></header><section class=post-content><h2>Random Read/Write Speed</h2><p>The four corners of SSD performance are as follows: random read, random write, sequential read and sequential write speed. Random accesses are generally small in size, while sequential accesses tend to be larger and thus we have the four Iometer tests we use in all of our reviews.</p><p>Our first test writes 4KB in a completely random pattern over an 8GB space of the drive to simulate the sort of random access that you'd see on an OS drive (even this is more stressful than a normal desktop user would see). I perform three concurrent IOs and run the test for 3 minutes. The results reported are in average MB/s over the entire time. We use both standard pseudo randomly generated data for each write as well as fully random data to show you both the maximum and minimum performance offered by SandForce based drives in these tests. The average performance of SF drives will likely be somewhere in between the two values for each drive you see in the graphs. For an understanding of why this matters, read <a href=#>our original SandForce article</a>.</p><p><img alt="Desktop Iometer—4KB Random Read (4K Aligned)" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph6337/50426.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Random read speed is good but not 840 Pro level. Some of this can be due to the slower NAND as the queue depth of our random read test is only 3—with higher queue depths the difference between 840 and 840 Pro should be closer.</p><p><img alt="Desktop Iometer—4KB Random Write (4K Aligned)—8GB LBA Space" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph6337/50424.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><img alt="Desktop Iometer—4KB Random Write (8GB LBA Space QD=32)" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph6337/50425.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Random write speed is a bit odd as performance does not scale up with higher queue depths. Speculating on the cause is difficult, but if I had to guess I would say it's firmware related, not NAND this time. Samsung is most likely doing some very aggressive write combining and caching so it's easy to achieve the same level of performance regardless of queue depth.</p><h2>Sequential Read/Write Speed</h2><p>To measure sequential performance I ran a 1 minute long 128KB sequential test over the entire span of the drive at a queue depth of 1. The results reported are in average MB/s over the entire test length.</p><p><img alt="Desktop Iometer—128KB Sequential Read (4K Aligned)" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph6337/50427.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Samsung's read centric firmware approach with the 840 really shows off in our low queue depth sequential read test: there is no drive faster than it.</p><p><img alt="Desktop Iometer—128KB Sequential Write (4K Aligned)" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph6337/50428.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Sequential write is pretty poor compared to today's other 256GB SSDs but Samsung is only claiming 250MB/s so this shouldn't come as a surprise. The similarity between random and sequential write speed helps back up what we mentioned earlier: Samsung is likely being very aggressive with its write combining to make random IOs look very sequential.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIN0f5Zoqpqlo6q7qHnSrJtmcGRlenOBj6CZZqqVq7amw45v</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./maury-povich-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Maury Povich Net Worth 2022: Income Explored</span></a>
