That’s the reason the family pressed no charges.”</p><p>The family never even knew Lopes was famous until after her death, the boy’s grandmother told The Post last night.</p><p>“We didn’t realize she was someone famous. She was a normal person,” Berta Martinez said.</p><p>“At the time, we weren’t worried about who she was. We just knew she picked up my grandson and rushed him to the best hospital in the area.”</p><p>Martinez said the family believes that “no one was at fault” in the accident.</p><p>Rob Goldstone, of TLC’s management company, told The Post yesterday that Lopes’ family “has heard of the previous accident report, and at this time is too distressed to make any comment because they’re organizing a funeral.”</p><p>He said Lopes’ body was flown from Honduras to Atlanta yesterday, accompanied by her brother, Ron.</p><p>A private viewing will be held in Atlanta tomorrow night “for family and close friends only,” Goldstone said.</p><p>Funeral services will be held Thursday at the New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in Atlanta and “fans are expected to be at the service,” he said.</p><p>“It is expected that a number of celebrity performers who are friends of Lisa and her family will sing in the service,” Goldstone said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2JlfXN7j21mbGhfobKnwIyesJ6rXauur3nKoqOlnZRirm6vx6KjnWWnmrKsv4ybnJ%2Bnopp6qbHRZqawpl2ZsqLAx2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dusty-baker-baseball-manager.html><span>←</span><span>Dusty Baker Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</span></a>
