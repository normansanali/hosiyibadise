Plaza recently took to <a href=#>Instagram</a> to pose with a stuffed penguin in an all-white <a href=#>witch</a> costume to promote the release of The Return of the Christmas Witch, which she co-wrote with Dan Murphy. Naturally, since Penguin Books is the publisher, the stuffed penguin was the perfect photo shoot accessory.</p><p>While Aubrey Plaza’s books are plenty kid-friendly, her upcoming series for HBO Max will definitely not be. Aubrey Plaza is set to have a big role in the upcoming second season of the Emmy-winning series <a href=#>The White Lotus</a>. The anthology series is returning for another season of rich people and intrigue with a brand new setting in Italy.</p><p>Jennifer Coolidge and Jon Gries will be reprising their roles from the first season of The White Lotus but the cast is brand new otherwise. Along with Aubrey Plaza, the new cast includes Sabrina Impacciatore, Haley Lu Richardson, Michael Imperioli, F. Murray Abraham, Adam DiMarco, Theo James, Meghann Fahy, Will Sharpe, Beatrice Granno, Tom Hollander, Simona Tabasco, and Leo Woodall. Mike White returns as writer, director, and showrunner.</p><p>There is a lot of anticipation around the second season of The White Lotus, especially after the first seasons cleaned up at the Emmys. The series managed to nab Outstanding Writing, Outstanding Directing, Outstanding Supporting Actress for Coolidge, Outstanding Supporting Actor for Murray Bartlett, Outstanding Limited or Anthology Series, and several more. Although Aubrey Plaza hasn’t had an Emmy nomination in her career yet, The White Lotus could certainly change that.</p><p>Along with starring in a prestigious drama TV series, Aubrey Plaza also has an extremely prestigious film role in the near future. Plaza is set to have a supporting role in the ambitious Francis Ford Coppola project Megalopolis. Megalopolis will be about an architect rebuilding New York City as a utopia after a major disaster.</p><p>A film by Francis Ford Coppola is truly a rare event, as the auteur director rarely releases a project these days. Megalopolis is especially anticipated because it’s enough of a passion project for Coppola that he’s almost entirely financing the film himself. The cast is incredible too, as it also stars <a href=#>Adam Driver</a>, Forest Whitaker, Nathalie Emmanuel, Chloe Fineman,&nbsp;Isabelle Kusman,&nbsp;D.B. Sweeney, Bailey Ives, Dustin Hoffman, &nbsp;Jon Voight, Laurence Fishburne,&nbsp;Talia Shire, Shia LaBeouf, Jason Schwartzman, Grace Vanderwaal, Kathryn Hunter, Madeleine Gardella, James Remar, and the aforementioned Aubrey Plaza.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.giantfreakinrobot.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Spin-Me-Round-900x487.jpg><p>According to <a href=#>Deadline</a>, Megalopolis is set to shoot in Georgia sometime this Fall, but we won’t have to wait until the far-off release of that film to see Aubrey Plaza again. Fans of The White Lotus and those new to the series can check out the new season when it hits <a href=#>HBO Max</a> on October 30. In the meantime, you can see Plaza in her most recent movie role Spin Me Round or you can check out her animated series Little Demon on Hulu when the new episode comes out this Thursday, October 13.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXAp6ufqpWWuKq60aiZqKxemLyue8Klq6tno5qybq3Um6mesV2luaLGwGauoqyTnXqxsc2grKKmXp3Brrg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./387466-rubi-rose-reacts-to-kanye-west-bootlegging-onlyfans-porn-on-reddit-news.html><span>←</span><span>Rubi Rose Reacts To Kanye West Bootlegging OnlyFans Porn On Reddit</span></a>
