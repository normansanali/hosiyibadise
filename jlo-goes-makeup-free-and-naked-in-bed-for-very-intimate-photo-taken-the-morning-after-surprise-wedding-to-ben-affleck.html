Love is beautiful. Love is kind. And it turns out love is patient. Twenty years patient.”</p><p>She included a photo of them laughing together during what appears to be their big day, as the&nbsp;New York&nbsp;native is wearing what looks like a&nbsp;wedding&nbsp;dress.</p><p>JLo continued in her letter: “Exactly what we wanted. Last night we flew to Vegas, stood in line for a license with four other couples, all making the same journey to the wedding capital of the world.</p><p>“Behind us two men held hands and held each other. In front of us a young couple who made the three hour drive from Victorville on their daughter’s second birthday – all of us wanting the same thing – for the world to recognize us as partners and to declare our love to the world through the ancient and nearly universal symbol of marriage.”</p><p>She then shared details with fans about her and&nbsp;Ben’s arrival at the wedding chapel.</p><p>“We barely made it to the little white wedding chapel by midnight. They graciously stayed open late a few minutes, let us take pictures in a pink Cadillac convertible, evidently once used by The King himself (but if we wanted&nbsp;Elvis&nbsp;himself to show, that cost extra and he was in bed).”</p><p>She continued: “So with the best witnesses you could ever imagine, a dress from an old movie and a jacket from Ben’s closet, we read our own vows in the little chapel and gave one another the rings we’ll wear for the rest of our lives.</p><p>“They even had Bluetooth for a (short) march down the aisle. But in the end it was the best possible wedding we could have imagined. One we dreamed of long ago and one made real (in the eyes of the state, Las Vegas, a pink convertible and one another) at very, very long last.”</p><p>The hitmaker went on and added: “When love is real, the only thing that matters in marriage is one another and the promise we make to love, care, understand, be patient, loving and good to one another.</p><h2><strong>BIG CHANGES</strong></h2><p>“We had that. And so much more. Best night of our lives. Thank you to the Little White Wedding chapel for letting me use the break room to change while Ben changed in the men’s room.</p><p>“They were right when they said, ‘All you need is love.’ We are so grateful to have that in abundance, a new wonderful family of five amazing children and a life that we have never had more reason to look forward to. Stick around long enough and maybe you’ll find the best moment of your life in a drive through in Las Vegas at twelve thirty in the morning in the tunnel of love drive through, with your kids and the one you’ll spend forever with.”</p><p>The letter concluded: “Love is a great thing, maybe the best of things – and worth waiting for.”</p><p>Her marriage to Ben isn’t the only big life change she’s made, however.</p><p>The Jenny From The Block&nbsp;singer&nbsp;signed off her newsletter “Jennifer Lynn Affleck,” suggesting&nbsp;she took on her husband’s last name.</p><h2><strong>IT’S OFFICIAL</strong></h2><p>Hours before the newsletter was sent out, reports surfaced that Ben and JLo were married.</p><p>TMZ&nbsp;obtained records that showed that the couple applied for a marriage license in Clark County,&nbsp;Nevada.</p><p>At the time, the Clark County Recorder’s Office revealed that the pop star possibly changed her name to: “Jennifer Affleck.”</p><p>The marriage license was reportedly taken on Saturday, July 16.&nbsp;</p><p>The license was held in both of their legal names: Benjamin Geza Affleck and Jennifer Lynn Lopez.</p><p>A source connected to the alleged married couple confirmed to the site that&nbsp;they indeed had gotten hitched.</p><p>Another insider told&nbsp;PEOPLE&nbsp;that they wed in a “small” ceremony.</p><p>“It was super, super small. They just wanted to be married so they got married,” the source revealed.</p><h2><strong>LOVE HISTORY</strong></h2><p>JLo and Ben first began dating&nbsp;back in 2002 after meeting on the set of their romantic/comedy caper, Gigli.</p><p>However, in 2004, the two broke off their engagement.</p><p>Their&nbsp;love affair&nbsp;progressed when they rekindled their relationship in May 2021.</p><p>They reconciled after the Hustlers actress&nbsp;called it quits&nbsp;with former Yankees star&nbsp;Alex “A-Rod'” Rodriguez, 46, in April 2021.</p><img decoding=async alt="JLo shares first photos and videos from Las Vegas wedding to Ben Affleck" width=295 height=188 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/AB-JLO-COMP-3-1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <img decoding=async alt="Ivana Trump’s funeral details revealed with children all set to attend service" width=295 height=188 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/LM_ivanafuneral_comp.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>The hitmaker shares her twins,&nbsp;Emme and Max, with her ex-husband&nbsp;Marc Anthony, 53.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ben shares&nbsp;three children, Violet, Seraphina, and Samuel, with his ex-wife,&nbsp;Jennifer Garner, 50.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/comp-skc-jlo-twin.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ES_JLO_BENKISS_COMP.jpg><h3 class=article-boxout__headline>We pay for your stories!</h3><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The US Sun team?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue9OvqqGnp5e2u3vJpaZmn5%2BawG65wKScrqhdm7%2BmsYyapZ1lnpa4prCMoqVmmpWZeqe70WatnqqpYravwMimmK2dXaW1sMDOZquao5WjerW0xGakqKqenruoecCfq56qXajCs7zRoqqeZaeasaW1zaBkraddl7KvecCfnaWdk6B8</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jayr-tinaco.html><span>←</span><span>JayR Tinaco Age, Girlfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</span></a>
