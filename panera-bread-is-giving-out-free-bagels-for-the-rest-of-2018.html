The chain announced at the start of December that it plans to hand out bagels free of charge for the remainder of the year, but there are some strings attached.</p><p>In order to get a free bagel from now until December 31, customers must first sign up for the company’s <a href=#>MyPanera Rewards</a> program. From there, diners can hit up their local Panera to get a free bagel every day until the calendar officially changes from 2018 to 2019. Talk about carb-loading!</p><p>Per the terms and conditions of this bagel-rific promotion, it’s only available at all of the Missouri-based corporation’s U.S. locations, and cannot be applied to online orders. Furthermore, those who are already signed up for MyPanera can’t get in on the free bagel fun seeing as the offer only applies to new members.</p><p>And even though a free bagel is, well, a free bagel, those who like to top their pastries with butter, jelly and other condiments might have to fork over some money to ensure the bagel is prepared to their liking, as the promotion “excludes cream cheese and other spreads.”</p><p>Despite the restrictions, Panera customers seemed psyched at the prospect of closing out the year with some free bread. Many with pre-existing MyPanera accounts have said that even though the offer is only meant to apply to new users, they’ve been able to get daily bagels at no charge as well.</p><p>“So far, Panera Bread has given me the best birthday <a href=# data-gift=1>gift</a>… a free bagel everyday for the whole month,” one Twitter user wrote. Added another: “Panera giving me a free bagel every day is the closest we’ll ever get to world peace.”</p><p>Scroll down for some additional reactions:</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Panera: Have a free bagel every day in December!</p><p>Also Panera: Our locations are all closed on December 25th.</p><p>sowhatisthetruth.gif</p><p>— 🕎 Joe Kessler 📚 (@lesserjoke) <a href=#>December 11, 2018</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Got a free bagel from Panera for breakfast<br>Getting free Bibibop for lunch</p><p>Happy bday to me 🙂</p><p>— Kaleigh Treviño (@kay__trev) <a href=#>December 10, 2018</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I just found out that I get a free bagel every day this month at Panera.
