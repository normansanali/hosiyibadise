First, the large prevalence of extremely mild or asymptomatic cases means that many people are not getting tested while ill, not even realizing they have Covid.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Second, the National Institutes of Health also reports that at-home Covid tests have now surpassed PCR tests and clinical tests for usage. People will rarely, if ever, report a positive at-home test to officials, meaning it will not be included in official figures.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>According to official numbers, 33,716 Americans are recording an infection every day.
