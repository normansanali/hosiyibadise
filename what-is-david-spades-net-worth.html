The man is always switched on, and at this point no one has found a way to turn him off.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=496 data-current-count=496 data-injectable=true>In many ways he’s a caricature, a carnival reflection of his best features. Lampooning has long been Spade’s bread and butter, and with a career spanning over 30 years, his life revolves around his hilarious characters. He writes them, plays them, improvises them on TV, and has made some serious money along the way. That kind of longevity is hard to achieve in the entertainment world, and with that much time in front of the camera, one begins to wonder: How much is this guy really worth?</p><p data-characters=529 data-current-count=529 data-injectable=true>The <a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a> alum has a generally accepted net worth of around $60 million according to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>. Much of that money comes from television and film; however, the star also maintains a large real estate portfolio that nets him a pretty penny each year, too. In 2013, he sold his home in Malibu for $10.3 million, then bought a $2.3 million home in West Hollywood during the pandemic and owns a massive estate in Beverly Hills worth upwards of $20 million. That’s a lot of coin for the 57-year-old bachelor.</p><p data-characters=375 data-current-count=375 data-injectable=false>Speaking of, the Grown-Ups star has been busy this year acting as one of the hosts for the coveted ABC program Bachelor in Paradise. A strange choice at first glance, but one that makes perfect sense knowing that Spade is a massive Bachelor fan. Over the years, he’s been more than vocal about his adoration for the show, lovingly making jokes on late night television.</p><p data-characters=86 data-current-count=461 data-injectable=true>Take a look⏤the guy is obsessed. No really, and check out the mutton chops on Spade:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=12 data-current-count=312 data-injectable=false>And another:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=612 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=355 data-current-count=355 data-injectable=false>Interestingly enough, his Bachelor in Paradise salary has been a topic of debate amongst fans, with people across the internet speculating about what the comedian is getting paid to watch beautiful people hate each other. By all accounts, Spade is making anywhere between $300,000 and $500,000 for the season. Not bad for the self-described “old man.”</p><p data-characters=374 data-current-count=729 data-injectable=true>That self-deprecation has also been a hallmark of Spade’s humor for years and it doesn’t just get laughs, it makes him relatable. Starting at SNL in 1989, David Spade is considered (rightfully so) one of the greatest cast members of all time. His sarcasm and everyman attitude scored serious points with audiences and propelled the Arizona native to a new level of fame.</p><p data-characters=246 data-current-count=246 data-injectable=false>Leaving SNL in 1997 after <a href=#>Chris Farley’s tragic death</a>, Spade went on to star in some of Hollywood’s funniest films, including The Benchwarmers, Grown Ups, and Hotel Transylvania, which have helped him net more of that $60 million fortune.</p><p data-characters=186 data-current-count=432 data-injectable=true>Speaking of another bachelor, here’s a great story of how Jack Nicholson stole David Spade’s girlfriend. Sometimes you’re the pigeon and sometimes, well, you’re the statue.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=294 data-current-count=594 data-injectable=false>David Spade might look like an everyman, but he doesn’t have the wealth of one. In fact, he’s got much more. Frankly, as one of the entertainment industry’s most easygoing guys, why shouldn’t he have a little bit of money tucked away? He played Joe Dirt, after all. Enough said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorqGZpGK2tHnDmq2inF2ovaKwxKxkp52kYsSwvtOhZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-happened-to-brett-delaura-on-the-real-love-boat-illness-as-crohns-disease-and-health-update-452383-html.html><span>←</span><span>What Happened To Brett DeLaura On The Real Love Boat?
