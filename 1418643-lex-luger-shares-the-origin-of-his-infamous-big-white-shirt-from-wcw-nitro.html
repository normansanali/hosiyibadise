Luger had been working for WWE in 1995, but his contract expired after SummerSlam. Luger worked a house show match for WWE on September 3, and surprisingly showed up on the WCW Nitro debut the following night.</p><p>During that Nitro segment, he showed up wearing a <a href=#>big white shirt</a>. As years passed, fans wondered why he picked that shirt. One other question still remained — did Luger still own the shirt. He answered it in the most recent episode of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE’s The Bump</a>.</p><p>WWE’s Matt Camp asked if Luger bought the shirt in the Mall Of America that day. Luger said that wasn’t possible, and shared more history about the shirt.</p><p>“Are we going to the big white Nehru shirt?… No. They had me hidden away, I couldn’t have gone shopping. That would have blown the surprise. I actually… That was a custom-made shirt that an NBA superstar who played 23 seasons in Atlanta… I’m an Atlanta guy now. Born in Buffalo but now Atlanta,” Luger explained. “He made me all my first custom made suits, Kevin Willis. And he was also a clothier and he made me that shirt years before and just, I always loved that shirt.</p><p>“And when I had the big moment for Monday Nitro, I came home from Newfoundland or something on the road with WWE. I wrestled a tag match against Shawn Michaels and Scott Hall, I had to go home and grab something. I grabbed the big white shirt with the Nehru Collar. The rest is history,” Luger said.</p><p>Luger also revealed that he gave the shirt to a person he’s mentoring.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZNqb29sY2K5psSMpaygnaJiwKmt0Z6qZqyYmnqwvsigoKdln5t6qbXSZqCnnpGivLa%2FjJugoGWnnba1sYysn6KqpGKzs7vMZq6cr12jtrW%2Bzg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kayla-itsines-biography-height-net-worth-boyfriend-career.html><span>←</span><span>Kayla Itsines : Biography, Height, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Career</span></a>
