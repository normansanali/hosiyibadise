Jack here reporting on my first baking love – molten chocolate cake. See, way before this blog, I pretty much had one staple “date night” dish. That dish was seared scallops and it was always a hit. Well, one Valentine’s Day, I decided to kick it up a notch and shoot for the moon… by trying out&nbsp;molten chocolate cakes. I had never made anything like a molten chocolate cake before, and for those unfamiliar, it’s a cake that spills out chocolate sauce when you cut into it. It’s a great show when it works. My&nbsp;first time making…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Valentine’s Day doesn’t have to be all about fancy cooking and elaborate meals. If pasta making sounds too stressful, try this cozy one-pot stew that’s perfect&nbsp;for two. (With maybe a little leftover, if you eat less than we do). It doesn’t get much easier than this – sauté leeks and mushrooms in an oven-safe pot or this adorable heart shaped one.&nbsp;Add tomatoes, chickpeas, couscous and – the fancy part – a&nbsp;few pinches of saffron. Yes, saffron is expensive but a little goes a long way. Plus, it’s Valentine’s Day&nbsp;so let’s live a little. Pop it in the oven and bake…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>As a kid, I was obsessed with&nbsp;everything rainbow – my Rainbow Brite doll, a fresh&nbsp;new&nbsp;Crayola 64 pack (with built in sharpener!), and best of all&nbsp;– the rainbow-neon terminal at O’Hare airport. Pure magic. Nowadays, I have a new grownup rainbow obsession: rainbow chard. Cooking with Rainbow Chard If you’ve never cooked with rainbow chard before, it has a slightly bitter, earthy taste that I love to pair with sweet, tangy, and nutty accents. Aside from its gorgeous vibrant color, it has a special superpower: it’s kind of two vegetables in one! Not only can you use the chard leaves, but…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>I realize this post might not be the most timely. If you’re snowed in, chances are you’re not reaching for a cold salad – BUT it’s not snowing here and nothing will ever stop me from craving big bright salads for lunch. (If you need something hot&nbsp;today, click here, here, or here). My lunch salads are what I would call “kitchen sink” style. I toss&nbsp;whatever veggies I happen to have into a bowl… often with chickpeas and&nbsp;a bit of feta cheese or a scoop of hummus. For crunch, I add&nbsp;toasted nuts and/or hemp seeds. And to bring it all together…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Hi everyone, Jack here. The northeast is getting absolutely hammered with a snowpocalype, and when that happens, we know that most people just want to bundle up, binge watch some TV, and make simple, comforting dishes. So we dropped everything to get you a list of some of our favorite winter soups, stews, and a great hot chocolate drink.&nbsp;First thing’s first (pictured above) is our&nbsp;Spicy Black Bean Soup. Creamy Polenta & Mushrooms&nbsp;is not only one of my favorite&nbsp;looking dishes&nbsp;but it combines two of my favorite things – creamy comfort food and mushrooms. Want something hearty?&nbsp;Sweet Potato Vegetarian Chili&nbsp;is what you…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE POST >>>></a><p>Hi everyone, Jack here again. Super Bowl Sunday is right around the corner and you know what that means? Dip! Even though I’m not traditionally in love with avocado, I love the way Jeanine makes guacamole, and plus, nothing says “go team” like go-ji, right? Right? Now you may be thinking “oh, Jeanine has Jack writing this because he’s a football man or something.” Well, I have to admit, team sports are not my thing. Three things that ARE&nbsp;my thing, and the reasons I’m manning this post, are Super Bowl&nbsp;parties, food dipped in other food, and goji puns. This mango…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>In this frigid weather, nothing sounds better to me than soups and sandwiches. But if you’re like me and you keep&nbsp;tortillas on hand more regularly&nbsp;than&nbsp;bread – quesadillas are the perfect little soup or salad accompaniment. I always love to sneak&nbsp;a few greens into my food&nbsp;but today there’s no hiding it. These green-on-green-on-green quesadillas start with&nbsp;spinach tortillas&nbsp;that I stuffed&nbsp;with cheese, jalapeños, cilantro and sliced collard greens (feel free to sub spinach, kale, or whatever you have on hand)… and pickled shallots&nbsp;for a bright tangy bite. These are especially good with our Spicy Black Bean Soup.</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Hi everyone, Jack here reporting in from the frozen tundra&nbsp;of Chicago. We flew in for a quick weekend over Jeanine’s birthday (happy birthday!!!) and it is just beyond cold. Austin’s apparently snowing today, but still, not much prepares you for walking outside into 9ºF (-13ºC) weather from a nice, warm airport. This&nbsp;blog is almost always about making meals completely from scratch, but it’s cold times like this that sometimes you just want to pour a box of mac&nbsp;and cheese into a pot&nbsp;and go to town. Well we did that, posted a photo here on Instagram, and people went crazy for…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>When I’m not in the mood to cook (and yes, that happens), our dinner often looks something like this roasted cauliflower salad. While there are a lot of salads on this blog, I probably don’t post as many kale salads as I actually consume. I love them because they’re hearty and filling and are pretty much a blank canvas for any seasonal vegetable. Plus, they’re great to pack away for lunch the next day. Kale might be “so last year,” but it’ll always have a special place in my heart. How to Make This Roasted Cauliflower Salad This is a…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>I’ve had this miso soup in the queue for a little while now. Which isn’t normally the way I work, but I knew this humble healthy&nbsp;soup would get little love in between all of the sparkly &&nbsp;sprinkle-y holiday recipe madness. So I saved it especially for this week, which is otherwise known as the soupiest, salad-iest week on the internet. Inspired by our love of Japanese cooking, this recipe is nourishing, light, and refreshing – perfect for a winter reset. Miso Soup Ingredients Here’s what I use to make this healthy miso soup: Kombu.&nbsp;Kombu is dried seaweed used to make…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Happy New Year! Today I’m guest posting over at Better Homes and Gardens’ Dish Delish Blog. These granola bars were inspired by their recipe for Chocolate-Peanut Butter Granola Bars, which&nbsp;reminded me of the ones my mom used to pack into my school lunch everyday. I might not have that Barbie and the Rockers lunchbox anymore, but I thought it would be fun to recreate this favorite afternoon treat in a healthier way. My version is packed with goji berries, chia seeds, pistachios, pepitas, (and of course, chocolate)… These are so quick & easy to make.&nbsp;Click over to the BHG Dish…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbvVnpinnJyaurC60meaqKVfmK61scaoqbJnopqwqrzEZqCnnJWterO7zq1mrJ2RqLyve8%2Banp5naW58</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./travis-jason-kelce-dad-ed-secret-health-condition.html><span>←</span><span>Travis and Jason Kelce's dad Ed reveals secret health condition</span></a>
