The premiere kicked off starring none other than the late actor <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Leslie Jordan</a>. And it was a tearful moment for many when the "darling" of the Internet was seen on the screens for the last time. The episode was shot just days before his tragic death, and seeing the star give back to his best friends was a wonderful tribute.</p><p>In the episode, Leslie 'thanked' his longtime best friends <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rosemary Alexander and Newell Alexander</a>. The tear-jerking episode shows fans the friendship between the trio as Leslie reunites with his best friends. The Alexanders and Leslie share a longtime friendship that dates back to Leslie's early days as a novice actor. According to Leslie, the Alexanders have supported him from day one and helped jumpstart his acting career. For those who want to know more about this couple, here are the details about the closest friends of the '<a href=# rel>Will and Grace</a>' actor.</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">‘Celebrity IOU’ Season 4 Part 2 full cast list: Meet the hosts and the celebrity guests on hit HGTV show</a></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'Celebrity IOU': Anthony Anderson plans 'emotional' home renovation for brother Derrick</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/98428099-30ca-42b7-ac1d-9c878995d1ea.png><h2 class=split>Who are Rosemary and Newell Alexander?</h2><p>Rosemary and Newell were the late Leslie’s closest friends. The trio met nearly four decades ago when they were all new to show business. Together, Leslie, Rosemary, and Newell have starred in many projects such as ‘Sordid Lives,’ and the couple has also produced Leslie’s one-man show ‘Hysterical Blindness And Other Southern Tragedies That Have Plagued My Life Thus Far.’ Rosemary first met Leslie when the two starred in a play where she acted as his therapist. Rosemary and Newell, too, share Leslie's southern roots. The late actor said about the couple, “They’ve just always been there for me,” while also adding, “I had some struggles with alcohol, a little drug use. I’m 25 years clean and sober, but they were instrumental in that too, because they never judged me.” Leslie spent almost every waking moment of his youth at the Alexanders’ home and had become a part of their family. Leslie, too, viewed the couple as his family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/dee3643a-0fb3-4a51-a533-37459feeb17d.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/meaww.com///d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/9cb1c026-333b-4855-8a1e-aa1adbc4ea6c.png><p>Leslie, who died in a tragic car crash at age 67, surprised his friends Rosemary, 81, and Newell, 87, with a complete renovation of their old ranch-style house just weeks before his accident. Collaborating with the 'Property Brothers’ stars Drew Scott and Jonathan Scott, Leslie transformed their home into a modern abode that Newell described as “country western modern.” While redecorating the Alexanders’ home, Leslie showed plenty of deliberation as he picked out everything from door frames to faucets keeping in mind the couple’s likes and dislikes.</p><p>‘Celebrity IOU’ Season 4 Part 2 airs Mondays on HGTV at 9/8c and is also available for streaming on Discovery+</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRom5WhsqO%2ByK2wZqGfqnq0scCspqdlZGK9or7TZmlmr5ikeqK%2BxGapqKuVoq6zxYyapZ1lnprEprjLZpilnaiWu6Wx0Q%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./why-is-tony-khan-wearing-a-neck-brace.html><span>←</span><span>Why is Tony Khan wearing a neck brace?</span></a>
