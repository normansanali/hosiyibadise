Liam also got a visit from the family’s longtime pediatrician Dr. Saul, who Spelling said is part of “our family” in her Instagram Story. “The recovery process begins,” she added. “ It’s going to be a long journey but we take it day by day.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Tori-Spelling-Reveals-Why-Son-Liam-Had-Foot-Surgery-Inline-01.jpg><p>The Beverly Hills, 90210 actress initially shared her love for Liam on Wednesday, December 13, as he headed into surgery.</p><p>“My 1st baby waiting to go into foot surgery…Not sure who’s more nervous him or mama,” the actress wrote via Instagram. Despite her own nerves, Spelling praised Liam’s strength: “Proud of your bravery @liammcdermott and things can only get better after this.”</p><p>Liam is the eldest of the five children that Spelling shares with estranged husband <a href=#><strong>Dean McDermott</strong></a>. The pair also co-parent daughters, Stella, 15, and Hattie, 12, and sons, Finn, 11, and Beau, 6. McDermott has another son, Jack, 24, with ex-wife Mary Jo Eustace.</p><p>Things have been rocky for Spelling and McDermott, 57, in the last several months. In June, McDermott announced via Instagram that he and Spelling were getting a divorce. (He later deleted the post.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Tori-Spelling-Reveals-Why-Son-Liam-Had-Foot-Surgery-Inline-02.jpg><p>In a November 15 interview, McDermott told the Daily Mail that he had completed 40 days in rehab over the summer and was now living in a sober home with eight other men. He also revealed that he <a href=#>had not seen</a> Spelling or his children since posting about his marriage on Instagram and shared that he tried to <a href=#>end his life</a> that night.</p><p>“’After I sent the post, I took some more pills, and I took six or seven Ambien in the hopes that I would not wake up. Thank God I did. Because I would’ve ruined so many lives if I had died,” he said in the interview.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Since his split from Spelling, McDermott has been spotted out with Lily Calo multiple times including <a href=#>dropping her off</a> at LAX, where the pair shared a kiss. Spelling, meanwhile, has been spotted with CEO <a href=#>Ryan Cramer</a>.</p><p>Spelling and McDermott met in 2005 on the set of a made-for-tv movie while they were both married to other people.
