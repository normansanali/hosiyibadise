<a href=../../../yvonne-orji-quarantinis-interview.html></a>
Emmy-nominated Yvonne Orji, who stars as Molly on Insecure, popped into a virtual happy hour, a.k.a. Quarantinis, with members of Hearst Black Culture last month to chat about what success and self-contentment mean to her. Orji, who is also a stand-up comedian and podcast host, shared her wisdom about applying her energy to the things that matter, redefining what success means to her, and why she's done with people-pleasing.

Zendaya continued her sporty style pivot with a little help from Lacoste.
At a recent promo event for her new film Challengers in Sydney, Australia, the star embraced tennis-core in a sparkly white set custom-made by Lacoste creative director Pelagia Kolotouros.

One underrated component of a red-carpet look is…drumroll, please, the nails! When a star arrives, the first thing people tend to admire is the dress; then, eyes go to the makeup and hair, and last but certainly not least come the nails. A good manicure, though, shouldn’t be slept on, as prim and proper tips really have the power to make or break a look — and Zoe Saldaña’s subtle but sweet Oscars manicure is proof.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>AMD Discontinues Gaming Evolved App</h2><time>Sep 15, 2024</time>

With the recent launch of AMD’s Radeon 400 series parts and consequent focus on hardware, it’s been some time now since we’ve heard from AMD about their Gaming Evolved application. As it turns out, there’s a reason for this. Thanks to some digging by the crew over at WCCFtech, it turns out that AMD discontinued the application last month and will no longer be distributing or supporting it.
The Gaming Evolved App was back in 2013 as part of the Radeon 200 series launch.</article><article class=post-entry><h2>ASRock Shows Off B450 Lineup: Something For Everyone</h2><time>Sep 15, 2024</time>

Me. Ariana Grande’s new makeup line, r.e.m. beauty, is based on nothing less than the very concept of space. It’s a timely theme. Brave, even. Billionaires have recently ruined space, but Grande, a longtime NASA insider and possible NASA plant, is still going hard for it, and I respect that. It’s important to remember that space didn’t ask for any of this. It’s possible, I suppose, that r.</article><nav class=main-nav><a class=prev href=../../../post/page/30/>← Prev Page</a>
