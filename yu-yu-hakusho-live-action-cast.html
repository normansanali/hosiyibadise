Thanks to the platform, we are getting a live-action <a href=#>One Piece</a> series, a live-action <a href=#>Resident Evil</a> show, and let's not forget that it's giving fans a series of movies based on <a href=#>Avatar: The Last Airbender</a>.</p><p>Luckily, the love of nostalgia doesn't stop there. Old school anime fans can look forward to something else: a live-action version of the series <a href=#>Yu Yu Hakusho</a> which is based on the manga of the same name by Yoshihiro Togashi. Here's what we know about the cast, release date, and more so you can get your popcorn ready.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is on the cast of 'Yu Yu Hakusho'?</h2><p>Right now, it seems like Netflix is still trying to figure out who is going to be a part of the final cast, but two of the main members have been announced so far. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a>, Yu Yu Hakusho's main character, Yusuke Urameshi, will be played by Takumi Kitamura. He's been acting since 2008 and is best known for his role in Tokyo Revengers.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>"The original work is a universal and unique masterpiece and a reason why Japan is so proud of its strong manga and anime culture," Takumi said to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IGN</a>. "I am happy to share the masterpiece of Yu Yu Hakusho with the world, and I hope we can create something people everywhere will enjoy."</p><p>In addition to Takumi, we know that Yoko Kurama, the fox demon, will be played by Jun Shison. He's an actor and a voice actor who may be best known to American audiences for his role in the live-action adaptation of the live-action version of <a href=#>The Way of the Househusband</a>.

It will be directed by Sho Tsukikawa who told the publication there will be lots of action scenes for fans to enjoy. At first, he wasn't too sure about making the live-action version because he didn't even think it would be possible.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>unveiling the cast of the live-action Yu Yu Hakusho over the next few days! stay tuned to this thread <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/2LUzsDhM3r</a></p>— Netflix Anime (@NetflixAnime) <a href=#>July 16, 2022</a></figure><p>Luckily, Sho decided to be a part of the Netflix series after he was able to speak to its producer, Akira Morii, and learned about the different effects the streaming platform could make happen. This left Sho "burning with passion to make this project come to life," and he also understands what this project could mean to fans.</p><p>Although he doesn't get specific, Sho tells IGN that the production is using "cutting-edge technology" for its visual effects and he believes what fans truly love about the original Yu Yu Hakusho besides the battles, are the characters and their different relationships. "I will continue to pour my heart and soul into the project to deliver the best entertainment from Japan to the world."</p><p>You can watch the original Yu Yu Hakusho on Crunchyroll and <a href=#>Hulu</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrsJuxdRmn5qjpai1sHnLoq2eZZGYwaq7zWaamquk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./109851-luke-combs-net-worth-age-spouse-songs-awards-labels-profiles-html.html><span>←</span><span>Luke Combs net worth, age, spouse, songs, awards, labels, profiles</span></a>
