He later moved it to Speedwell and Sussex Avenue where business grew.</p><p>A complete renovation was done in 1994. A year later, Marty opened Marty's 2 in Succusunna on Route 10, which eventually moved into a new building in Randolph. A third shop later opened in Hackettstown.</p><p>Hundreds of people hold memories of Marty and his shop close to their hearts.</p><p>"Marty was more than a shop owner,"&nbsp;Bryan Fennelly said. "Marty’s passion for the community is literally etched in the bike lane markers of South Street. Marty gave to the community and gave to the sport selflessly.</p><p>"As I think about my first, second, third, and fourth bikes I bought from his shop, conversations with him over the years I am simultaneously smiling and brought to tears."</p><p>"The last time I saw Marty- I told him we would be riding 70 miles on his 70th this year (and every year),"&nbsp;Jessica Gill McGinn said. "He lit up and said, 'That’s great. I will ride my e-bike. You will certainly be riding with us Marty -- today and every day."</p><p>"Marty was a great human being and a friend to cyclists everywhere," Mike Rabens added. "His kindness and enthusiasm were contagious."</p><p>"Marty was a generous, inspirational, kind man," said Martin Gallagher, "who leaves behind a legacy of charity and cycling in Morristown and beyond."</p><p><strong>Check back for arrangements.</strong></p><p class=e-click-here-follow-btn data-testid=bottom-paragraph><a class=e-email-signup js-follow-button data-testid=article-click-here-to-subscribe href=#>Click here</a> to follow Daily Voice Morris and receive free news updates.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmickZ65usLOopqeZpOkunC6xLBko52iqLK6e8yoqauho2S8o7XTrpiroZWofLW%2ByJusrZ1doryzvsisq6ivnmK6sMHRp6pmpZGnwbq%2FjKucpaGRl7mmecKymqWdXaTEr7HRZqSaqqSueqa80q2coqZda4Zwg5VwanJsXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./grammy-performers-reactions.html><span>←</span><span>The Grammy Performers Rooting Each Other On Is So Sweet and Twitter Can't Get Enough</span></a>
