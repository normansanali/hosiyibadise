Despite the fact that his life was a very short one, Mindler was certainly able to find success through his acting and already had seen significant results from the efforts he put in to his work. With a recurring role on As The World Turns, and a significant role in Our Idiot Brother, Matthew Mindler was making great money and had already amassed a net worth of $2 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Twitter Responds To Matthew Mindler's Death Being Ruled A Suicide</a></span></p><h2 id=matthew-mindler-39-s-last-role-was-in-2016><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Matthew Mindler's Last Role Was In 2016</span></h2><p>Matthew Mindler's last role was in the 2016 TV movie Chad: An American Boy. This movie centered around a boy named Chad, who was struggling to get through the awkward and challenging years of adolescence, only to find himself having to take on the role of the man of the house. Celeb Hook reveals that Matthew Mindler played the role of Peter in this movie,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> which only received a one star rating</a>.</p><h2 id=he-was-focused-on-his-education><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>He Was Focused On His Education</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though he was seeing success with his acting career, roles were sometimes hard to come by and there were numerous gaps between jobs. Matthew Mindler was excited about putting his focus on his education and creating a scheduled lifestyle which included higher learning opportunities. He was enrolled in college in Pennsylvania and had told his mother he was enjoying his first few days and starting to really settle in, before tragedy struck.</p><h2 id=he-suffered-from-crippling-anxiety><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>He Suffered From Crippling Anxiety</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Matthew Mindler's mother has come forward to indicate that he was suffering from what she termed as being 'crippling anxiety' at the time of this death, but she indicated that he seemed to have been managing things much better in the days leading up to his death. She had taken him to a series of professionals and therapists to assist him in creating coping mechanisms for his anxiety, and Matthew seemed to be showing signs of marked improvement.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Miss Mercedes Morr Is Mourned By Fans After Murder Suicide</a></span></p><h2 id=he-was-reported-missing-from-university><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>He Was Reported Missing From University</span></h2><p>At the time that he went missing and the search for Matthew Mindler began, he was enrolled in Millersville University in Pennsylvania and was living in their residences. Mindler had maintained regular correspondence with his mom, who was carefully keeping tabs on his anxiety levels, when suddenly, he failed to respond, and officials confirmed he was also missing from his residence on campus.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=matthew-mindler-39-s-death-was-ruled-a-suicide><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Matthew Mindler's Death Was Ruled A Suicide</span></h2><p>Sadly, three days after being reported missing from his room on campus, the college freshman and child star was found deceased in Manor Township, which was in close proximity of his school. Mindler's cause of death wasn't immediately apparent, but within days, news of his shocking cause of death would be revealed to the world.</p><h2 id=the-shocking-cause-of-death><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>The Shocking Cause Of Death</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The coroner declared that Matthew Mindler's official cause of death was sodium nitrate toxicity. He had ingested dangerous and unsustainable levels of sodium nitrate and had died immediately, as a result. Sodium nitrate is a substance commonly used in the preservation of some types of foods, primarily in meats, but is very dangerous when consumed in substantial quantities.</p><h2 id=his-suicide-was-thoroughly-researched><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>His Suicide Was Thoroughly Researched</span></h2><p>Perhaps the most devastating facts that were revealed about this case were the ones that surfaced after the coroner's report was revealed. Matthew Mindler's mother began to dig deep into the last few days of her son's life to see if she could better understand what led him to take his own life. She discovered that his suicide was well researched.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He had spent much time online learning about what level of sodium nitrate would lead to suicide, and there were many internet tabs devoted to different ways to end his own life. Mindler ultimately ordered a bag of sodium nitrate from Amazon which cost him no more than $15. The contents of that bag contained enough to kill four grown people.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Twitter Mourns Kid Cudi’s Dog After Learning It Saved Him From Suicide</a></span></p><h2 id=there-were-no-warning-signs><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>There Were No Warning Signs</span></h2><p>There were no clear warning signs that Matthew Mindler was contemplating suicide, according to Mindler's mom. If anything, he seemed to be adjusting very well to school and had been happy during their last few conversations with one another. The battles and demons that Mindler was grappling with had proven to be a very quiet, internal struggle, and he gave no signs that trouble lay ahead.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-mother-39-s-warning-to-every-parent><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>A Mother's Warning To Every Parent</span></h2><p>Since her son's death, Matthew Mindler's mother has made it her mission to ensure he didn't die in vain. She has been vocal about his cause of death and has issued a warning to all parents to monitor what their children do online, and to ensure that they are vigilant in encouraging everyone to take mental health seriously. She warns other parents of the dangers of online shopping and the ease and affordability which her son was able to obtain this dangerous mixture of sodium nitrate.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:<a href=#> Fans Fear For Lil Durk’s Mental Health After Troubling Texts Surface</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicr52irsGptc2gZLCdXaC7sMOMmpmoraRiwam10maaoaGcmXq0wMCrqmakmZuybq3FrZyrZZaWuqZ5wKebZqCZqHq1vsCgoJxllJqutbSMppitrJiaxG65yKebpZ2iZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./beyonce-3.html><span>←</span><span>Beyonc Age, Net Worth, Husband, Family &amp;amp; Biography</span></a>
