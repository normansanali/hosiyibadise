Rycroft informed her fans at the time that<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> she suffered from “major stomach issues” </a>including “severe cramping.” The Dancing With the Stars alum told Entertainment Tonight that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her parents even worried that she was dead.</a></p><p>“There was one report that was out that I was dead,” Rycroft said at the time. “My parents were frantically calling me that morning going, ‘We are getting people calling with their condolences.’ Like, ‘Mom, I’m on the phone with you. I’m in my bed.’”</p><p>The Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders: Making the Team judge is also a mom herself.

And now it’s been what, 11 years? I don’t really need to go back because it’s so far away,” Rycroft explained. “However, of course, I’m getting sent screenshots, and memes, and stuff that people are now watching and finding. I had, like, the poof in my hair. I was wearing tank tops and scarves, it was a mess. There was no YouTube to show us how to contour, or do makeup. … I mean, it’s just an embarrassing time that was documented that people are getting to relive it again.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGabmZOdsq270WaYpa2dYrqmuMisqpploq6ws7vFrWSgnaSoeqO%2BxJqqrWWZor2trc2tqmaqlaK8t7HDaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-rachel-hollis-dating.html><span>←</span><span>Who is Rachel Hollis Dating Now</span></a>
