It’s been an interesting month or so [and] I’ve been going to a few Chiefs games,” Swift’s second cousin <strong>Danny Frye III</strong> told <a href=# rel=noopener>FloRacing TV</a> in a Saturday, January 13, interview. “You know, [I] made a love connection between her and Travis Kelce, so it’s been quite the 34 years that [Taylor and I have] had together.”</p><p class=p1>Frye, a dirt track racer, has previously been spotted in a private box with Swift, 34, at Kelce’s Kansas City Chiefs games. (Frye told FloRacing that while he and Swift are technically second cousins, they “grew up pretty close.”)</p><p class=p1>Swift <a href=#>has been dating</a> Kelce, 34, since summer 2023.</p><p class=p1>“There were definitely people she knew that knew who I was, in her corner [who said], ‘Yo! Did you know he was coming?’ I had somebody playing Cupid,” Kelce told <a href=# rel=noopener><i>WSJ. Magazine</i></a> in November 2023, seemingly hinting at Frye’s identity without mentioning a name. “She [later] told me exactly what was going on and how I got lucky enough to get her to reach out.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Taylor-Swifts-Cousin-Danny-Frye-III-Hints-He-Made-Love-Connection-Between-Singer-and-Travis-Kelce-2.jpg><p class=p1>Kelce expressed interest in Swift the previous July, mentioning <a href=#>on his “New Heights” podcast</a> that he saw her <i>Eras Tour </i>concert in Missouri and made a friendship bracelet with his phone number to exchange. However, they weren’t able to meet and Kelce felt “butthurt” by the missed connection.</p><p class=p1>Once Kelce’s podcast comments were sent to Swift, they “started hanging out right [away],” which she recalled to <i>TIME </i>in a December 2023 cover story.</p><p class=p1>“So we actually had a significant amount of time that no one knew, which I’m grateful for because we got to get to know each other,” Swift added to the outlet.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Swift and Kelce took their relationship public two months after the podcast clip went viral. She attended her first Chiefs game in September 2023, sitting in a private box with Kelce’s mother.</p><p class=p1>“By the time I went to that first game, we were a couple,” Swift added to <i>TIME</i>. “I think some people think that they saw our first date at that game. We would never be psychotic enough to hard-launch a first date.”</p><p class=p1>The Grammy winner has since been a staple at Kelce’s football games throughout the 2023-2024 season. She most recently <a href=#>attended Saturday’s AFC Wild Card game</a> against the Miami Dolphins, where she wore her boyfriend’s jersey number for the first time. <strong>Kristin Juszczyk</strong>, whose husband is San Francisco 49ers fullback<strong> Kyle Juszczyk</strong>, designed Swift a <a href=#>custom puffer coat</a> made out of Kelce’s #87 jerseys. Swift’s pal <strong>Brittany Mahomes</strong> wore a matching one with husband <strong>Patrick Mahomes</strong>’ details.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGawoJ9iva2t2J6bZpulpbalecWoqWaska65sL6MrK6inqRirq%2BwjK2pmq6ZqHqsscucnGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-are-the-different-ajahs-in-the-wheel-of-time.html><span>←</span><span>What are the different Ajahs in The Wheel of Time?</span></a>
