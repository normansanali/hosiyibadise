I'm still waiting for the final, shipping 240GB Vertex 3 to arrive before passing judgement on it but from what I've seen thus far it looks like that may be the drive to get if you're torn between the two. I feel like if you're going to be working with a lot of incompressible data (e.g. pictures, movies) on your drive then you'll want to either go for the 240GB version or perhaps consider a more traditional controller. The performance impact the 120GB sees when working with incompressible data just puts it below what I would consider the next-generation performance threshold.</p><p>The bigger question is how does the 120GB Vertex 3 stack up against similar capacity drives from the competition? Unfortunately with only a 300GB Intel SSD 320, a 250GB Intel SSD 510 and a 256GB Crucial m4 on hand it's really tough to tell. I suspect that the drive will still come out on top given that the rest incur a performance penalty as well when going to smaller capacities, but I don't know that the performance drop is proportional across all of the controllers. I hate to say it but you may want to wait a few more weeks for us to get some of these smaller capacity drives in house before making a decision there.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/reviews/storage/OCZ/Vertex3/120/DSC_2829sm.jpg width=600 height=436 border=0 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>It's clear to me that these SF-2000 based drives are really best suited for use with a 6Gbps interface. Performance over 3Gbps is admirable but it's just not as impressive. If you've got an existing SF-1200 drive (or similar performing drive) on a 3Gbps system, I don't believe the upgrade to a SF-2200 is worth it until you get a good 6Gbps controller.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIFzgZVoq6GdXaSwu3nVnqmtnahigG6%2BxK%2Bgnq9dZn9xs8FoaG0%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./taylor-swift-and-travis-kelce-are-sparking-rumors-on-getting-engaged-soon.html><span>←</span><span>Fact-Check: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce Are Sparking Rumors On Getting Engaged Soon</span></a>
