Welcome to Temple, Quincy Patterson! ü¶â<br><a href=#>#TempleTUFF</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/3cTMlPTd0j</a></p>‚Äî Temple Football (@Temple_FB) <a href=#>June 8, 2022</a><p class=p2><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Quincy Patterson II</a> made a name for himself as Virginia Tech‚Äôs signal-caller for three seasons. The Fan Arch athlete recorded 813 yards, six touchdowns, four interceptions, a 54.5% completion percentage, 660 rushing yards, and seven rushing touchdowns for the Hokies.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p2>However, things didn‚Äôt work out between <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Quincy Patterson II</a> and the Hokies, and he surprisingly transferred to the powerhouse North Dakota State. It didn‚Äôt take long for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Quincy Patterson II</a> to fit in with the Bison, as he led the team to a<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp; </span>7-0 record in games he started.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p2><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Quincy Patterson II</a> rushed for seven touchdowns and threw for six more while averaging 5.8 yards per rush.
