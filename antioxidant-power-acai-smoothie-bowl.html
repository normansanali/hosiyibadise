We were in California and we heard from our friends that we had to try the growing in popularity acai bowls topped with fresh fruits and homemade granola. We were intrigued.</p><p>As soon as we finished our first acai bowl, we were hooked. I had to figure out how to make them at home. I figured out how to make them for a lot less money and I am passing on the tips and tricks to you!</p><p>My health-nut daughter took her first job at our local acai bowl place, worked there for years, and<strong> learned how to make the best acai bowls</strong>!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Smoothie-Bowls-14-720x976.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is an Acai Smoothie Bowl?</h2><p>Acai berries have gained popularity in popular acai smoothie bowls. Acai Bowls are a thick fruit smoothie placed in a bowl and topped with fresh fruits, granola, cacao nibs, unsweetened coconut flakes, honey, and more. It is usually thicker than a smoothie and contains less liquid and more frozen fruit.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What is Acai?</h2><p>Açaí,&nbsp;<strong>pronounced&nbsp;ah-sigh-EE</strong>, comes from the acai berry grown on the acai palm tree in South American rainforests.</p><p>The acai fruit is small, round, and has a deep purple color.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>What does acai taste like?</h3><p>The taste of acai berries has been described as a blend of chocolate and berries. Acai is relatively lower in sugar compared to other fruits, so it makes the base not as sweet.&nbsp;</p><p>Acai berries have been called a superfood, and the benefits can be debated. According to Medical News Today…”acai berries contain more antioxidants than other commonly eaten berries. They also are high in fiber and heart-healthy fats.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Acai-Bowl-4-crop-720x726.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Acai Bowl Ingredients:</h2><ul><li><strong>Frozen Acai Berry Packets</strong> — use unsweetened frozen acai packets or sweetened acai berry packets. You can find frozen Acai packets at Costco, Whole Foods, Sprouts, or other</li><li><strong>Blueberries</strong> — use frozen blueberries for extra antioxidant benefits, a deeper color, and a deeper flavor.</li><li><strong>Strawberries</strong> – use frozen strawberries for extra sweetness and nutritional benefits. Strawberries are extremely low in calories and are high in Vitamin C.</li><li><strong>Banana</strong> — this adds the perfect amount of natural sweetness. I suggest using a frozen banana. The riper the banana was when frozen, the sweeter it will be in the Acai bowl.</li><li><strong>Apple Juice, Coconut milk, or Almond Milk</strong> — if you want a sweeter acai bowl, I suggest using apple juice. If you want a creamier acai bowl, use coconut milk or almond milk.</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Acai Bowl Toppings:</h3><p>The sky is the limit on what toppings you would like to put on your smoothie bowl. Any fresh fruit would be delicious as well as nuts butters, dark chocolate shavings, and granola.</p><ul><li><strong>Sliced Banana</strong>: Brings a sweet taste to the Acai bowl. Banana is soft and has a stronger flavor that compliments the Acai well.</li><li><strong>Fresh Strawberries</strong>: A lighter and fresher flavor that pairs well with the other fruits in the bowl.</li><li><strong>Fresh Blueberries</strong>: More fresh fruit with a slight crunch. Tastes great with the Acai base.</li><li><strong>Granola&nbsp;</strong>— I prefer making <a href=#>homemade granola</a> because I love being able to control the amount of sugar. Most acai shops use the Nature’s Path Hemp Granola. It has the perfect amount of sweetness and crunch.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Almond Butter</strong>: You can your favorite nut butter, such as peanut or cashew butter. The savory nutty flavor is the perfect balance to the sweet fruits.</li><li><strong>Cacao Nibs or Dark Chocolate</strong>: Cacao nibs are dried bits of cacao beans, which are the base of chocolate. Acai has been described to have a chocolate taste, so adding dark chocolate or cacao nibs is the perfect pairing.</li></ul><p>More topping ideas include — unsweetened coconut flakes, peanut butter, honey, hemp seeds, fresh fruits, and more.</p><p>If you prefer a more tropical bowl, you can add fresh fruits like mango, papaya, passion fruit, and coconut flakes.</p><p>For more fresh and light recipes, you can find my <a href=#>Fresh Juice Cleanse Recipes</a>, and my <a href=#>Six Superfood Smoothie Recipes</a>.

A high-powered blender, like a <a href=#>Vitamix</a> or Blendtec, works best to make smoothie bowls.</p><strong class=schema-faq-question>Why is my Acai bowl not thick?</strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>You may be using too much liquid. Try to slowly add the liquid in as you blend so that you avoid putting in too much.<br>Use frozen banana and frozen blueberries to thicken the smoothie. You want an Acai bowl to be thick enough to spoon rather than drink or sip.</p><strong class=schema-faq-question>How can I add protein to my Acai bowl?</strong><p class=schema-faq-answer>Açaí bowls are a great form of micronutrients since they’re packed with vitamins and antioxidants. If you want it to be a more balanced source of macronutrients (carbs from the sugars, fats from the Acai berries) you can add some protein.<br>You can add a scoop of your favorite protein powder to the blend (vanilla is my favorite, but chocolate could be good too if you prefer a richer base) or add some plain Greek yogurt, which is naturally high in protein.</p><p>I love to hear from you!
