<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>What is the Difference Between Otterbox Symmetry and Commuter</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Otterbox is an American company based in Colorado that provides shock resistant, drop-resistant and water-resistant mobile cases. It was started in the year 1998, and since then, it has been manufacturing different types of cases for the protection of smartphones. Otterbox symmetry and Commuter cases are very popular among the iPhone users because it protects three things mentioned above.</p><h2 id=otterbox-symmetry-vs-commuter><span class=ez-toc-section id=otterbox-symmetry-vs-commuter></span><strong>Otterbox Symmetry vs Commuter</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>The main difference between Otterbox Symmetry and Commuter case is that Symmetry cases are a one layered case, and the design of the mobile cover is very sleek and thin. While Commuter cases have two layers of protection, one from outside i.e. hard and the other from inside. Because of this, it has a very bulky design. Symmetry case doesn’t contain port cover, whereas commuter cases contain port cover.</strong></p><p>Otterbox Symmetry cases have very beautiful and wonderful designs. As it has a single layer of protection Symmetry design is very sleek and tender. It is available in various colour options. Those who are fashion lovers will love Symmetry cases. The texture of the Symmetry case is very smooth and soft, which lets it easily fit into pockets. It is easy to press and control your buttons in symmetry as it provides less resistance.</p><p>Commuter cases are thicker and because it protects two layers. Its design is bulky. Because of its thickness, it has a grip, so the phone will not fall easily from the hands. It protects against drop-resistant, water-resistant and shock-resistant. Its back is changeable. It also consists of a port cover. It has fewer colour options available i.e. block colours. But the colours of the cases are permanent and will not fade away.</p><h2 id=comparison-table-between-otterbox-symmetry-and-commuter><span class=ez-toc-section id=comparison-table-between-otterbox-symmetry-and-commuter></span><strong>Comparison Table Between Otterbox Symmetry and Commuter</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2 id=what-is-otterbox-symmetry><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-otterbox-symmetry></span><strong>What is Otterbox Symmetry?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Otterbox Symmetry case is very easy to remove and install because it has a single layer. It is very sleek i.e. slim in design. But it doesn’t mean that it offers less protection. It is DROP+ rated and can withstand drops thrice, and is at par with military standards. Symmetry also has a raised bevelled edges, which means that if it falls or drops, then its camera lenses and screen will remain protected.</p><p>No harm will be caused to it. Symmetry cases are pocketable as it is very thin so it can come in any type of clothing. It is also best suited for fashionable people because it comes in a lot of designs and variations. It is perfectly suited and is available in four options such as Graphics, Case, and Clear Case with MagSafe. It also comes in four colour variants: Cake Pop Pink, Earl Grey, Black, and Rock Candy Blue.</p><p>It also comes in other variants for the people who are adventurous in nature like Stardust Glitter, Wallflower Graphic, or Moon Walker Graphic, Enigma, Shell-Shocked Graphic. All in all, it contains 12 colours. Those who have MagSafe chargers like Apple users then they should opt for the MagSafe series, which is available in two options. Models of Symmetry are available for all phones except for T Mobile and Asus. It is compatible to work with wireless charging.</p><h2 id=what-is-commuter><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-commuter></span><strong>What is Commuter?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Commuter cases come with a changeable back. Like symmetry, Commuter can also fit well in the pockets. But due to its thickness, it is difficult to adjust in the tight pocket area. The commuter has two layers of protection and is made up of rubber. Sometimes due to this rubber, it can become an entry point for dust and dirt. It is designed in such a way that it is double the thickness of the phone.</p><p>It is very easy to hold as it has a tight grip because of its thickness. Sometimes the polycarbonate plastic in the bottom of the case can crack. It protects the smartphones from dust and dirt, unlike symmetry. It is also drop-resistant. It is only available in solid colours such as Black, Ballet Way Pink, Bespoke Way Blue, and Ocean Way. It lacks variations. Commuter series makes it easier and stress-free to use phones.</p><p>However, at times it may be a little bit difficult due to its bulky size to reach the buttons of the smartphones as it offers very little resistance. It is very easy to use the headphone jack and charging point in commuter cases. It is more protective in the long run. It is available in a variety of models like Samsung, OnePlus, Google, Apple, LG, Asus, Motorola, and T-Mobile. Commuter cases are very durable.</p><h2 id=main-differences-between-otterbox-symmetry-and-commuter><span class=ez-toc-section id=main-differences-between-otterbox-symmetry-and-commuter></span><strong>Main Differences Between Otterbox Symmetry and Commuter</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><li>Otterbox Symmetry has one layer.
