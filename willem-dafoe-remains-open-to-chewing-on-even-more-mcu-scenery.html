The franchise could always find an excuse to have his character turn evil again, or just have a variant from another universe pop in. We could even see <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dane DeHaan</a> return as his take on Peter Parker’s archenemy, although there’s nowhere near as much fan hype for his take on the character.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorqKknJq6brDAn6aeZaKauqK1zaxkqKiVo3q1u4ycn56vmaO0brvNZpyvnZ5iurC%2BxGaknK1dqLCmusSrsGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-is-jessica-tarlov-married-to-jessica-tarlov-family-nationality-wiki-height-weight-twitter-net-worth-age-instagram-and-more-537019-html.html><span>←</span><span>Who Is Jessica Tarlov Married To?
