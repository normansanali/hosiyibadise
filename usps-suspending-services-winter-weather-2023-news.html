The latest updates to the <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>USPS Service Alerts</a> website indicate that a significant number of facilities have just been shut down in multiple areas.</p><p>As of Feb. 24, more than 100 post offices are currently closed temporarily in six states: California, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/usps-closing-post-offices-feb-2023-news.jpg><p>The affected post offices may be spread across six different states, but they are all experiencing similar issues right now.</p><p>The Palomar Mountain Post Office in California was closed on Feb. 23 "due to winter storms," the USPS said in one alert. Separately, the Postal Service cited "weather" as the reason for the closures in Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota.</p><p>The agency closed two Iowa facilities in Maurice and South Amana, while it shut down 14 post offices in Minnesota, including those in cities such as Fairmont and Cologne. There were also 23 closures in North Dakota, impacting cities like Casselton and Ellendale, and 37 in South Dakota, affecting cities like Groton and Valley Springs.</p><p>Those aren't the only consequences of winter weather. The USPS stated in a Feb. 24 alert that it has temporarily closed retail operations at several post offices in Michigan "due to power outages caused by weather." There are 51 affected facilities in this state, including post offices in cities like as Franklin and Tecumseh.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=# rel=noopener>For more up-to-date information, sign up for ourdaily newsletter</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/snow-storm-truck-plowing-roads.jpg><p>Various storms are stressing postal systems in these states. A massive winter storm began hitting the Midwest on Feb. 21, prompting the National Weather Service (NWS) to issue <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>blizzard warnings</a> for portions of Iowa, Minnesota, and the Dakotas, CNN reported.</p><p>As part of the same storm system, heavy, freezing rainfall was forecasted to hit Michigan, according to the news outlet. More than 700,000 homes and businesses in this state are now <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>without power</a> as of Feb. 24 because of this storm, per NBC News.</p><p>And California is currently being threatened with a "<a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>rare blizzard</a>,"&nbsp;The New York Times reported. According to the newspaper, the storm began unleashing rain, heavy snow, and strong winds in some parts of the state on Feb. 23.</p><p>The NWS said this has created <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>blizzard conditions</a> over mountain passes, even in the southern part of California. Flooding and weak tornados are also possible in the state over the next few days as a result of this storm.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/usps-mail-delays-winter-news.jpg><p>Despite the hazardous weather, the Postal Service hasn't reported any delivery suspensions in its recent updates. In fact, the agency said in its alert for Michigan that "delivery operations will not be affected."<span aria-hidden=true>ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb</span></p><p>But never say never. In <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>local press releases</a> issued for both Iowa and South Dakota on Feb. 23, the USPS said this kind of dangerous weather could prevent people from getting their mail delivered.</p><p>"Delivery service may be delayed or curtailed whenever streets or walkways present hazardous conditions for letter carriers or when snow is plowed against mailboxes," the agency explained. "The Postal Service curtails delivery only after careful consideration, and only as a last resort."</p><p>To prevent this from happening to your home, the Postal Service is asking customers to clear any snow or ice from sidewalks, stairs, and mailboxes to ensure safe delivery service can continue without interruption from winter storms.</p><p>"With major snow accumulations covering the region, along with prolonged frigid temperatures, one tool is expected to make its return at homes and businesses—the shovel," the USPS said. "Snow and ice make delivery dangerous and slow. Maintaining a clear path to the mailbox—including steps, porches, walkways, and street approach—will help letter carriers maintain consistent delivery service."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBrbXFnqanpJmjsm%2BvzqZmrqugqHq0wdKpnKecmaO0br%2FEq62im5Woeri1za2cq2Wnmq61tMSrZGtoYmh6r7HWrGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./lyrics-there-is-no-one-like-our-god.html><span>←</span><span>There is no one like our god lyrics</span></a>
