Aside from the <a href=#>mental and physical training</a>, immersing oneself in a role and committing to it for months on end must be exhausting and intimidating, especially if they’re playing a popular character, because then there’s the pressure of living up to the public’s expectations. The expectation doubles if an actor is given the role of a villain. If they fall below what <a href=#>society thinks is a compelling villain</a>, they will get hated on. If they play the role a little too well, people will feel that they are bullies in real life. Either way, they risk being under public scrutiny for a long time. Many actors play the bad guy – or girl – in many contemporary films that people either adore or love to hate. Curious to see who they are?

Making his acting debut as a film extra, Danny Trejo managed to secure a slot on the set of Runaway Train. From then on, Danny played various characters in movies and on TV. Notably, he<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> played the villain</a> in Heat and Machete. Though he’d play the rough-and-tough guy on set, in real life, Danny is a sweetheart. In August 2019, Danny was a witness to a car accident and rushed to help a child who was still trapped inside the overturned car.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tom-hiddleston><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Tom Hiddleston</span></h2><p>Tom Hiddleston plays one of the most prolific and famous villains in superhero movie history and the main antagonist in<a href=#> the Thor film franchise</a>. The British-born actor originally auditioned to play the titular hero, Thor, at the time but was instead cast as the trickster Loki. It seems that the movie producers knew what they were doing at the time because since then, Tom Hiddleston has become a villain everyone adores. In real life, though, Tom is an absolute gentleman, unlike the character he portrays. He once even gave a shivering reporter some soup because they were cold.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=christoph-waltz><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Christoph Waltz</span></h2><p>Two-time Academy-award winner Christoph Waltz is so<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> good at playing the bad guy </a>that it’s hard seeing him in a non-villain role. His American breakout role in Quentin Tarantino’s film, Inglorious Basterds earned him left, right, and center accolades. Since then, he’d been given more prominent roles, such as the bounty hunter in Django Unchained and the main villain in Spectre. Yet, despite his impeccable grasp at playing the villains in movies, Christoph remains humble as most actors of his stature and prefers to keep his personal life away from the cameras.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="How Helena Bonham Carter's Childhood Tragedies Made Her A Star">How Helena Bonham Carter's Childhood Tragedies Made Her A Star</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=helena-bonham-carter><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Helena Bonham Carter</span></h2><p>Another actress that’s way too good at playing the antagonist is Helena Bonham Carter. Famous for her roles as Bellatrix Lestrange in Harry Potter and Madame Thénardier in Les Misérables, the English actress has repeatedly proven that she can play any role given to her to perfection. But more than the eccentric roles she plays, she’s also a sweet mom who takes her children out to play dates. She’s also very humble, frequently stating that she doesn’t like watching any movie or show that she’s in.</p><h2 id=charlize-theron><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Charlize Theron</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Charlize Theron seems to have perfected her murderous gaze as an actress. The<a href=#> actress who has a flawless skin</a> has earned numerous accolades for playing the beautiful but deadly villainess roles, such as Snow White and the Huntsman, where she played the iconic evil queen with the fatal stare. She also portrayed serial killer Aileen Wuornos in Monster, earning herself an Academy Award. Outside of her film credits, Charlize is a dedicated activist. She also founded the Charlize Theron Africa Outreach Project to help support the African youth in the fight against HIV/AIDS.</p><h2 id=javier-bardem><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Javier Bardem</span></h2><p>​​​​​​​</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Spanish actor, Academy Award, and BAFTA winner, Javier Bardem is also a multitalented actor who plays the villain roles a little too well. Javier has been in numerous films where he plays the bad guy, including in Skyfall and No Country for Old Men. In real life, Javier has been known to support and contribute to various causes related to environmental protection, refugees, and disaster relief. He also became a Greenpeace ambassador in 2018 to help raise awareness and the protection of Antarctica.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# title="This 'Harry Potter' Character Was Featured In Tons Of Other Hollywood Films">This 'Harry Potter' Character Was Featured In Tons Of Other Hollywood Films</a></span></p><h2 id=jason-isaacs><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Jason Isaacs</span></h2><p>​​​​​​​</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Famously known for his role as Lucius Malfoy in the <a href=#>Harry Potter film franchise</a>, Jason Isaacs is one actor who also seems to have perfected his wrathful gaze while acting on set. He also played the villain in films such as The Patriot and A Cure for Wellness. However, in real life, Jason is far different from his roles. He is involved with several charities, including Bravehound, a Veterans charity. He also expresses his distaste against racists, sexists, and homophobes frequently.</p><h2 id=ralph-fiennes><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Ralph Fiennes</span></h2><p>​​​​​​​</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ralph Fiennes is another multitalented and award-winning actor who seems to gravitate towards the villain roles instead of playing the hero. Famous for playing Voldemort in the Harry Potter franchise and ruthless Nazi Amon Goeth in Schindler’s List, Ralph seems to embody his roles with eerie-like accuracy. Besides his evil functions, Ralph is a known activist and supporter of various causes. He is a UNICEF UK ambassador who has worked in India, Kyrgyzstan, Uganda, and Romania, and a member of the Canadian charity Artists Against Racism.</p><h2 id=willem-dafoe><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Willem Dafoe</span></h2><p>​​​​​​​</p><p>Willem Dafoe is arguably one of the most versatile actors of his generation. Though he constantly delivers superb performances in any role, his acting prowess seems to show more whenever he plays the bad guy. Well-known as the <a href=#>Green Goblin in Spider-Man</a>, and as the antagonist in The Lighthouse, Willem delivers an edge to the villains he plays. In real life, though, Willem Dafoe is far from being harmful. He is a pescetarian and believes that animal farms destroy the planet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=anthony-hopkins><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Anthony Hopkins</span></h2><p>​​​​​​​</p><p>​​​​​​​</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Award-winning actor Anthony Hopkins</a> is one of the most prolific actors known both on screen and on the stage. Famous for playing the creepy psycho Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs, it seems that Anthony has a knack for taking a villainous role and transforming the character to make them even more terrifying. Although he can play a very effective villain, he is quite the opposite in real life. Anthony has supported various charities and even raised funds for preserving Snowdonia National Park in his hometown in north Wales.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=# title="Anthony Hopkins' Best Movies, According To IMDb">Anthony Hopkins' Best Movies, According To IMDb</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhoaWWRmMGwvtJmrqGnXaSztbHNZqelmaliu6azwK2gr51dp7ytsdJmpqdlo5i%2FprHNaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./category.html><span>←</span><span> | ROCK NOTE</span></a>
