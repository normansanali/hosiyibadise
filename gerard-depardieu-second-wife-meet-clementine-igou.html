<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Gerard Depardieu second wife: Meet Clmentine Igou</h1></header><section class=post-content><p>Amidst the legal turmoil surrounding renowned French actor Gerard Depardieu, a figure often celebrated for his prolific career spanning 170 movies, a spotlight has turned to the enigmatic Clémentine Igou, his second wife and partner of nearly two decades.</p><p>The actor, born on December 27, 1948, in Châteauroux, France, has faced recent legal scrutiny over alleged rape and sexual assault charges.&nbsp;The accusations date back to August 2018, when an actress claimed she was abused in Depardieu’s Paris flat between August 7 to 13 of that year. Although the case was initially dropped in 2018, it resurfaced in the following year, leading to criminal charges being filed against the actor. The ongoing legal&nbsp;saga&nbsp;has recently seen the case reopened.</p><p>Depardieu’s journey from leaving school at 13 to working in a print works, and later pursuing acting and dance in Paris, unfolds a narrative marked by acclaim and controversy. His first marriage to Élisabeth Guignot in 1970 bore two children, Guillaume and Julie. Following their separation, he welcomed daughter Roxanne in 1992 with model Karine Silla. In 2006, another chapter in his fatherhood began with the birth of his son Jean, shared with Hélène Bizot.</p><p>Presently, the 72-year-old actor resides with Clémentine Igou, his partner since 2005, creating a veil of privacy around their relationship. Igou, a 41-year-old Harvard University graduate, brings an intriguing dynamic to Depardieu’s life with a significant 30-year age gap. The couple, who crossed paths in 2004 in Italy, found common ground in their shared passion for wine. Igou, serving as a marketing director for a Tuscan Vineyard, aligns seamlessly with Depardieu, who also owns a vineyard in the region.</p><p>Despite their long-standing connection, the duo managed to keep their relationship discreet, stepping into the public eye only in 2014 when they were first photographed together. Beyond her role in marketing, Igou is a novelist, dividing her time between France and Italy.</p><p>As Gerard Depardieu’s legal&nbsp;saga&nbsp;unfolds, Clémentine Igou remains a mysterious yet integral part of the narrative, contributing her own story to the complex tapestry of the acclaimed actor’s life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJ%2BVp66zsIydnKmZopm2psGMrJycp56Zeri1xZ5kpp2VqXqkuMSmnKesmaOybrXGqKxo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./can-dirty-pillow-cause-acne.html><span>←</span><span>Can dirty pillow cause acne?</span></a>
