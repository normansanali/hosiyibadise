One thing that <a href=#>Speedball</a> was determined to prove was to show the wrestling world that he could match the skill set of Will Ospreay.</p><p>The duo put on an incredible show for the fans. After wrestling each other for over 17 minutes. Following the match, Bailey took to Twitter to share his gratitude. He also <a href=#>mentioned</a> that while he may have came up short, he certainly proved to the world that he can square up to the best of the best.</p><p>“Thank you all so much. I proved once again that I belong at the very top – I did come up short again and I’m a little tired of coming up short. But I’m super proud of the wrestler I’ve become, where I am now, and grateful for all the support. #BoundForGlory @IMPACTWRESTLING,” Speedball Mike Bailey <a href=#>tweeted</a>.</p><h2 id=h-tna-is-back>TNA is back</h2><p>Recently, Wrestling Observer’s Dave Meltzer appreciated the match as a whole. He mentioned that both stars put on a show that got the fans ‘going nuts’. He then ranked the match 5.25 stars.</p><p>Bailey reacted to Meltzer’s ranking.</p><p>“Getting 5.25⭐ for my match at BFG is honestly pretty cool! We are the 1st match in Impact to get this high of a rating since Joe/AJ/Daniels which feels insane. It’s all very subjective but the hope is that people continue to pay more & more attention to TNA ’cause WE’RE BACK!”</p><p>The previous record was 5 stars earned by the Christopher Daniels vs. Samoa Joe vs. AJ Styles match at TNA Unbreakable on September 11, 2005.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Getting 5.25⭐ for my match at BFG is honestly pretty cool!
