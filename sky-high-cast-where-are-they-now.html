Upon his arrival at Sky High, Will doesn’t appear to be as “super” as his parents, which lands him in sidekick classes. However, he quickly learns that the sidekicks are just as important as the school’s heroes.</p><p>“It’s completely refreshing,” Angarano told E! News in 2005. “There is that <a href=#>romanticism and superhero aspect</a> of it, but You take all of that out and you have, like, a <a href=#>John Hughes</a> high school movie that really works.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Danielle Panabaker</strong></a>, who plays Will’s childhood BFF, echoed her costar’s sentiment. “It’s so relatable. These guys are going through the angst of being in high school,” she told the outlet. “And then they’re set in this fantastic superhero world.”</p><p>Scroll down to see what the cast of Sky High is doing now:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BouLp5x6KeoWWTlsC1edahnKudXZa%2FpnnToZyyZZ6kxHA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sara-martins-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Sara Martins Net Worth</span></a>
