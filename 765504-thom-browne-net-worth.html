This strategic expansion allows Browne to maintain his unique design voice while reaching a broader audience. His shows are highly anticipated events within the fashion calendar, celebrated for their theatricality and the intricate storytelling that complements each collection.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Browne's success is not solely due to his creative talents but also his savvy understanding of the fashion business. In 2018, the brand took a significant step forward when Ermenegildo Zegna acquired a majority stake, providing the resources and infrastructure for global expansion while allowing Browne to continue as the chief creative officer.
