"I truly think he had an enlarged heart, and it just couldn’t keep up with him," she wrote, adding, "One moment he was walking around, and the next he was gone."</p><p>Ash continued to capitalize on Tater Tot's impact.</p><p>"I hope that his resilience during his short time here continues to inspire people. He was dealt a really tough hand with multiple health concerns, but he didn’t let that slow him down. He showed us that even if we have some struggles, there is always something to fight toward," she wrote.</p><p>In honor of his passing, Ash asked that fans make a donation to their local shelter in his name. "Please help his life continue to impact other animals in the world," she said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGStmaSav27Azq0%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./real-peaky-blinders.html><span>←</span><span>The True Story Of The Bloody Gang From 'Peaky Blinders'</span></a>
