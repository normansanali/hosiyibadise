Lindsay gave Abasolo her final rose during season 13 of The Bachelorette in 2017, and the pair exchanged vows in March 2019.</p><p>Shortly after news broke of the pair’s divorce, Abasolo<a href=#> shed light on the split</a> in a statement posted via Instagram.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Bachelors-Rachel-Lindsay-Is-Taking-Divorce-Day-by-Day-Shes-Just-Trying-to-Pick-Up-the-Pieces-2.jpg><p>“If you’ve been following me for a while, you know I don’t like to put my personal affairs on social media and like to keep a safe space for our family,” Abasolo wrote. “Many of you know me as a chiropractor, and also a husband, my proudest role so far. After more than 4 years of marriage, Rachel and I have made the difficult decision to part ways and start anew.”</p><p>Abasolo referred to himself as a “family man” and noted that his parents “have been married forever,” so the decision to file for divorce did not come lightly.</p><p>“Sometimes loving yourself and your partner means you must let go,” he continued. “I wanted you to hear it from the source before the blogs start making up their own reality.”</p><p>At the end of his message, Abasolo asked for privacy as he and his family “figure out” their next steps.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Bachelors-Rachel-Lindsay-Is-Taking-Divorce-Day-by-Day-Shes-Just-Trying-to-Pick-Up-the-Pieces.jpg><p>While the couple’s split sent shockwaves through Bachelor Nation, Lindsay and Abasolo had been <a href=#>candid through the years</a> about their relationship struggles.</p><p>As she rang in the new year, Lindsay hinted at her difficult 2023 in the caption of an Instagram video. “Definitely one of the hardest years of my life, but choosing to focus on grateful moments and carrying that energy into 2024. 💛,” she wrote days before Abasolo filed to end their marriage.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Lindsay previously gave listeners insight into her relationship during a December 2023 episode of “Viall Files,” noting that she and Abasolo had “totally different lives.”</p><p>“We don’t put ourselves out there at all [except] maybe an anniversary or a holiday [post here and there], but I think I did that because people were so critical of us when we came off the show,” she explained. “You know, marriage has ups and downs, but you never know when we’re good or when we’re not because we never put it out there.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGahp6dir6Kvx56jqKqVqcGmv4yrmJyglaF6rbXNnaqasV2ewG6vzqmgp59drLa1tIybqbKZnmKuo63SqKOoZZSew7C%2Bwp5m</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hal-walker-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-574296-html.html><span>←</span><span>Hal Walker Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</span></a>
