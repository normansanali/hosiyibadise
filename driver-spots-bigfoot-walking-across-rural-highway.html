His jaw just dropped open,” said Bartholomew. “But this is actually a very typical type of sighting.”</p><p>The witness, who asked not to be named due to possible ridicule, described the creature to Bartholomew as black and hairy with two legs, wide shoulders and a small neck, he said.</p><p>Sightings of Sasquatch crossing a road are the most common upstate and are usually reported in August and September, according to Bartholomew.</p><p>“Whether it’s a migration I’m not sure. But there’s a real consistency with the reports. People will be driving at night — and they describe seeing the same thing,” he said. “A forest road is the most likely a place for a person to have the opportunity to see the creature.”<br>A similar ape-like animal was reported half a mile away in September 2006. Hundreds more sightings have been reported in the area over the years, he said.</p><p>On Tuesday, the driver wasn’t able to snap a photo of the beast because it happened “too quickly,” he said. The animal left no footprint due to the rugged terrain.</p><p>Bartholomew and some scientists believe the animal may be a descendant of an ancient southern ape.</p><p>“There’s a rich history here,” Bartholomew said. “In the 70s this was a taboo but the subject is gaining traction.”</p><p>Last month, the village of Whitehall announced Bigfoot as its official animal.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlfnl7j3Fmamtfmb%2BqwsSrZKyon6nAbq7IoJ2op6RixKK4yqKloGWRmL%2Bwv9Jmqa6qkaF6qbXGoa6asV8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./derrick-lamont-coleman-age-wiki-biography-body-measurement-parents-family-salary-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Derrick Lamont Coleman Age, Wiki, Biography, Body Measurement, Parents, Family, Salary, Net worth</span></a>
