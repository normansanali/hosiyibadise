Before concluding this article, we will uncover his wealth. Meanwhile, let us delve into his other facets.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-robbie-gould-bio-and-career><strong>Robbie Gould bio and career</strong></h2><p>Gould is a former American football placekicker who played in the NFL for 17 years, primarily with the San Francisco 49ers and the Chicago Bears. From 2005 to 2015, he was a member of the Bears, where he achieved the remarkable feat of becoming the franchise’s highest-scoring player of all time.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Initially joining the New England Patriots as an undrafted free agent in 2005, Gould honed his skills playing college football for the Penn State Nittany Lions. Renowned for his accuracy, he ranks as the ninth-most precise placekicker in NFL history. Notably, Gould maintained a flawless record in the postseason, never missing a field goal or an extra-point attempt.</p><p>Gould was born in Jersey Shore, Pennsylvania to Cheryl and Robert Gould. His father, a talented soccer player, achieved great success at Lock Haven University, leading them to a Division II national championship in 1980. He was even drafted by the St. Louis Steamers in the early 1980s. Gould attended Central Mountain High School in Mill Hall, Pennsylvania, where he excelled in multiple sports including football, soccer, basketball, and track.</p><p>Initially, Gould had aspirations of pursuing a professional soccer career while still in high school. However, he ultimately decided to focus on football. Determined to make his dreams a reality, he requested his principal to send a letter of recommendation to Joe Paterno, the head football coach at Penn State University. Impressed by Gould’s potential, Paterno invited him to try out as a freshman walk-on.</p><p>Gould accepted the opportunity and enrolled at Penn State, where he played for the Nittany Lions football team. Alongside his dedication to football, he also pursued a degree in business management. Throughout his four years with the Nittany Lions, Gould showcased his skills by converting 115 of 121 extra point attempts and 39 of 61 field goal attempts.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Despite his impressive college career, Gould went undrafted in the 2005 NFL Draft. However, he was signed as a free agent by the New England Patriots, the reigning Super Bowl champions at the time. This move was surprising considering the Patriots already had a successful placekicker in Adam Vinatieri. Unfortunately, Gould was released during the preseason.</p><p>Undeterred, Gould then joined the Baltimore Ravens but was waived just three weeks later. He temporarily shifted gears and found employment in construction with M&R Contracting in his hometown of Mill Hall, Pennsylvania.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-why-is-robbie-gould-trending-what-happened-to-him><strong>Why is Robbie Gould trending? What happened to him?</strong></h2><p><strong><a href=#>Robbie Gould</a></strong>&nbsp;declared his retirement from the National Football League (NFL) on Thursday. This news was shared through an article penned exclusively for The Players’ Tribune.</p><p>“Now, although football has been a great part of my life for the past 18 years, it is with the utmost regard and appreciation that I officially announce my retirement from the National Football League,” he wrote.</p><p>Gould, at the age of 41, holds the impressive 10th position in the league’s history for points scored, with a total of 1,961. Additionally, he stands at the eighth spot for field goals made, with a remarkable 447. Notably, his career success rate of 86.4% on field goal attempts places him ninth among all players in the league.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Following the arrival of coach Kyle Shanahan and general manager John Lynch in 2017, Gould was among the first free agents to be signed by the San Francisco 49ers. Since then, he has consistently proven himself as one of the NFL’s most reliable kickers, solidifying his status as one of the league’s top scorers of all time.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-is-robbie-gould-net-worth><strong>What is Robbie Gould net worth?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ghbase.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/robbie2-1-696x392.jpg><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Robbie Gould’s estimated net worth is reported to be $22 million, as per multiple sources.</p><ul class=td-pulldown-filter-list></ul><a class="td-social-sharing-button td-social-handler td-social-expand-tabs" href=# data-block-uid=tdi_37 title=More><i class="td-icon-plus td-social-expand-tabs-icon"></i></a><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTBmqqeZpOkunC%2BzpuZop1dnLy2uMNmpZ6sXay8s8DHZp%2Bor12iwqS0jKKqZqCZqHq4u9Gtn2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./423995-new-trailer-for-black-adam-with-dwayne-johnson-arrives-watch-news.html><span>←</span><span>New Trailer For &amp;quot;Black Adam&amp;quot; With Dwayne Johnson Arrives, Includes Kanye West &amp;amp; Jay-Z Song</span></a>
