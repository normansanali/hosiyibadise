Judging by the bad buzz and dire tracking numbers on Evan Almighty, Steve Carrel’s overnight star-power will be tested when his $200-million-plus family comedy opens this Friday. Universal has been praying that it won’t flop — and aggressively marketing the biblically inflected comedy to Christian groups. They’ve partnered with co-producers Grace Hill Media to create ARKAlmighty, an online faith-based volunteer outreach community, and organized Christian rock and gospel concerts and radio broadcasts to promote the film."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

Universal has been praying that it won’t flop — and aggressively marketing the biblically inflected comedy to Christian groups. They’ve partnered with co-producers Grace Hill Media to create <a href=#>ARKAlmighty</a>, an online faith-based volunteer outreach community, and organized Christian <a href=#>rock and gospel concerts</a> and <a href=#>radio broadcasts</a> to promote the film. Even Pat Robertson’s Hollywood-bashing 700 Club has a special online section devoted to the film, <a href=#>“Evan Almighty: The Biblical Facts Behind Noah’s Ark.”</a> (It also helps that director Tom Shadyac has been vocal about his recent <a href=#>conversion to Christianity</a>.) Of course, Hollywood has been finding God ever since The Passion of the Christ. The real question: Will God save Produce Pete?

This movie has grown from the Christian overtones of Bruce Almighty to a character who becomes outright religious and reads Bible passages out loud … The movie is delight and will have you laughing about scenes that passed several minutes ago. And when you walk out, you’ll feel refreshed to walk your Christian walk.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-19d1284f0ecdf9073203e8a63fdaa44a-4-0-0@published data-word-count=5>Bill Reichart at <a href=#>Provocative Church:</a></p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-19d1284f0ecdf9073203e8a63fdaa44a-5-0-0@published data-word-count=57>“As a movie goes — this movie was hilarious.

The Christian blog <a href=#>The Parish</a> was furious to discover that the magazine Christianity Today had allowed Evan Almighty to purchase a cover ad from the magazine.
