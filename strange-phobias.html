An individual plagued with this crippling phobia is frightened that the pull of gravity will eventually crush them, or alternatively, that gravity will cease to exist and they will simply float off the face of the Earth. Strangely, a valid type of treatment for this phobia is listed as “exposure therapy”. We’re not sure how such a therapy would appear, exactly, but we would imagine it would look a lot like pure existence.</p><h2>Strange Phobias: Geliophobia</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-25864 alt="Strange Phobias Laughing" width=700 height=875 data-sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/PhobiasLaughter.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-25864 class=wp-caption-text>Source: <a href=#>Baba Klix</a></p><p>Geliophobia is the fear of laughter, and can be experienced by hearing others laugh, or by one’s own laughter. As with many phobias, symptoms vary in intensity – ranging from shortness of breath or rapid breathing to extreme anxiety, nausea, and uncontrollable shaking.</p><h2>Strange Phobias: Caligynephobia</h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-25857 alt="Strange Phobias Fear Of Beautiful Women" width=900 height=506 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/PhobiasBeautifulWomen.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-25857 class=wp-caption-text>Source: <a href=#>Imgur</a></p><p>Unlike Raj from the Big Bang Theory, who is thought to be suffering from gynephobia (the fear of all women) caligynephobia is the distinct fear of beautiful women; at least the ones the sufferer deems to be beautiful. Some have a constant fear, while others respond fearfully to more direct stimuli. We can’t imagine how caligynephobiacs would fare at a Miss America pageant.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufony0wNGapaCdXaW1sK7Imqo%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./steve-pool-dies-aged-70-cause-of-death-obituary-and-funeral.html><span>←</span><span>Steve Pool dies aged 70: Cause of death, obituary and funeral</span></a>
