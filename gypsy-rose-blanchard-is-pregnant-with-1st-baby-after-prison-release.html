<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Gypsy Rose Blanchard Is Pregnant With 1st Baby After Prison Release</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Gypsy Rose Blanchard</strong> is expecting her first baby with <strong>Ken Urker</strong> following her release from prison.</p><p>“I know the rumors have been flying around for quite some time now, and I’m happy to announce that I am 11 weeks pregnant,” Blanchard, 32, said in a <a href=# rel=noopener>YouTube</a> video shared on Tuesday, July 9. “Ken and I are expecting our very first child come January 2025.”</p><p>Blanchard added that the baby was “not planned,” but the twosome “are both very excited to take on this new journey of parenthood.”</p><p>Blanchard served seven years in prison after pleading guilty to the 2015 second-degree murder of her mother, <strong>Clauddine “Dee Dee” Blanchard</strong>. She was <a href=#>released in December 2023</a>. (Her ex-boyfriend <strong>Nicholas Godejohn</strong>, who killed Dee Dee after planning her murder with Gypsy, was convicted of first-degree murder in 2018 and is serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole.)</p><p>Five months after her release, Gypsy revealed that she wanted to start a family of her own. “Absolutely I <a href=#>want kids someday</a>. I think that I’m going to be a good mother,” she exclusively told Us Weekly in May. “I think [my boyfriend] Ken would be a wonderful father, and so we’ll see what the future holds for us.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Gypsy-Rose-Blanchard-Is-Pregnant-With-1st-Baby-After-Prison-Release.jpg><p>Despite her hopes for a family, Gypsy acknowledged at the time that she was still <a href=#>working through the alleged abuse</a> she suffered at the hands of her mother as a child. (Dee Dee allegedly put Gypsy through a series of unnecessary medical interventions — including surgeries and a feeding tube — while convincing Gypsy and the public that she was ill when she wasn’t.)</p><p>“I’m going through the healing process of processing those emotions that I feel towards myself and towards her,” she shared. “I have been diagnosed with PTSD and I am on medication for it. So then when the nightmares come, it puts me in a bad state of mind and it takes me a day to come out of that negative mindset and it takes work.”</p><p>Gypsy added that forgiving herself for her role in Dee Dee’s murder was “a daily work in progress” that she was “working on in therapy.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Following her release from prison, Gypsy went through a turbulent period in her love life. After marrying <strong>Ryan Scott Anderson</strong> in 2022 during her time behind bars, she <a href=#>filed for divorce</a> in April. Later that month, she <a href=#>confirmed that she was back together</a> with her former fiancé Urker, whom she met through a pen pal program in prison.</p><p>In May, Gypsy insisted that her connection with Urker <a href=#>did not directly cause her split</a> from Anderson.</p><p>“It was, I think, an insecurity that was there for a very long time,” she told Us. “I called Ken two weeks before I got married. Ken has consistently been brought up in a way that I can never let go of my feelings, but I put them on the back burner to do what was best for my marriage. And so, having that be a point of contention has been a thread throughout, but I didn’t leave Ryan for Ken. That was just sort of a realization [of], ‘Hey, we still love each other after the fact.’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGagsaCoxm6%2BzqycZpqclruktMCrm2aho2K9s7HGp5inrF2strW0jGqqrWWSlq%2B6ecCfq56qXaW%2Fqr%2FOp2SrnZyarrSxjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./garett-maag-essential-iphone-case.html><span>←</span><span>Garett Maag &amp;quot;Essential&amp;quot; iPhone Case</span></a>
