In one episode, she asks to visit her close friend Lilly who, as fans know, passed away last season from cancer. It was Lilly's funeral that she was desperately rushing home for when she was hit by a truck on the road.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3d3ab5470f11-virgin-river-hope-2-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eGNMtL4lknag data-wc=10><strong>In the new season, Hope is still regaining some memories</strong></p><p id=eep5LWshLn7u data-wc=32>Elsewhere, she is shown getting confused over a familiar recipe and even forgetting that central characters Mel, played by Alexandra Breckenridge and Jack, played by Martin Henderson, had visited her in hospital.</p><p id=ez5W7WqfAVMO data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a aria-label="Everything you need to know about Virgin River star Mark Ghanimé" class=hm-link href=#>Everything you need to know about Virgin River star Mark Ghanimé</a></strong></p><p id=ecU2heFkTIh2 data-wc=31>And for those wondering why Hope was absent from season three altogether - and almost didn't return for season four - it's because Annette was <a class=hm-link href=#>not able to fly to Vancouver last year when filming took</a> place due to the coronavirus outbreak.</p><p id=euzqtjbNTxm4 data-wc=66>Speaking to&nbsp;, showrunner Sue Tenney explained: "<strong>We were affected by COVID like every other show, and it was impossible for Annette to come and join us up here in Vancouver</strong>. Personally, I love Hope. I love the character, so we got busy in the writers' room to see how we can keep her alive in the show, with only having limited access."</p><p id=ePpj8HmJp49u data-wc=14></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5rZ2tqYGx%2Fc32Tb2hva1%2BrtrOzyKdkq6Gmmr9uv8SaqqimXZu8tr6MsJ%2BarF2drrG8xKecnWWkpHqpu8%2BeZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./catacombs.html><span>←</span><span>See Inside The World's Spookiest Crypts</span></a>
