The documentary film revealed the story of Simon Leviev, who allegedly swindled women he met on Tinder "for hundreds of thousands of euros," per <a href=#>Esquire</a>. Leviev, of course, isn't his real name, and he isn't the son of a diamond tycoon, either. Shimon Hayut is an ex-con who served time for scamming three women in Israel, and according to <a href=#>The Times of Israel,</a> he reportedly defrauded women out of $10 million.</p><p dir=ltr>"He ruined my life and shattered me emotionally and financially," said one of his victims (via Esquire). In February, Hayut claimed the documentary about him is a <a href=#>"made-up movie"</a> in an interview he did with <a href=#>"Inside Edition."</a>&nbsp;"I was just a single guy that wanted to meet some girls on Tinder. ... I'm not this monster," he said. Now a free man, Hayut is being sued by the Leviev family for benefiting from using their family name, per <a href=#>NBC News</a>. Because "turnabout [is] fair play," according to <a href=#>TMZ</a>, the Tinder swindler admitted to being swindled by a woman on Instagram for over $6,000.</p><p dir=ltr>As part of its "You Can't Make This Up" series, Netflix presented an investigative audio companion piece to the film called "<a href=#>The Making of a Swindler</a>." Hosted by the film's producer Bernadette Higgins and director Felicity Morris, the 3-episode podcast discloses new information about the conman's early life, his background, his criminal cohorts, and insight about what makes him tick.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcWhjZoJ3e9OrrJ5lk6e2rrGMra1mq5ikxLR5wqilp52TqbKledOoZKmnlJiutMDSaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./toni-braxton-sisters-name-and-ages-toni-braxton-age-birthday-album.html><span>←</span><span>Toni Braxton Sisters Name And Ages, Toni Braxton Age, Birthday, Album</span></a>
