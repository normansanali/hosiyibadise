While online discussions have <a href=#>criticized her diet for being overly restrictive and potentially promoting disordered eating</a>, the actress later clarified on her Instagram Stories that she doesn't adhere to this regimen every day. She emphasized that she consumes a broader variety of foods, debunking the notion that she was providing advice for others to follow.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Page Six, Paltrow blamed her post-Covid symptoms for her food choices saying, "The way it manifests for me is very high levels of inflammation over time, so I've been working with Dr. Cole to really focus on foods that aren't inflammatory. I eat full meals, and I also have a lot of days of eating whatever I want.

Just like <a href=#>Love Island's Molly Mae and her drastically different look</a>, Paltrow spoke about her personal journey, including a midlife crisis at 40, which led to an unfortunate experience with wrinkle-smoothing injectables, leaving her feeling unlike herself, "...It was a disaster. I didn’t do anything else for a long, long time. I was bruised, my forehead was completely frozen, and I didn't look like myself at all."</p><p>The Goop founder expressed the challenges she encountered during experimentation with procedures, shedding light on the reality that even those in the public eye can face unexpected outcomes. However, she also noted that she is now the face of Xeomin, an injection targeting frown lines between the eyebrows, which implies her comfort with responsible use.</p><p>Aside from discussing her experiences, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paltrow also shared insights into the evolving beauty standards in Hollywood</a>, particularly among younger generations. She praised the trend of appreciating women for their true selves, regardless of age or appearance, citing inspiring figures like Jane Fonda and Frances McDormand as examples.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Safe Are Gwyneth Paltrow's Cookbooks?</a></span></p><p>In a September 2020 Instagram post, the Academy Award winner discussed her skincare regimen and facial enhancements, acknowledging that dealing with aging is a multifaceted experience.
