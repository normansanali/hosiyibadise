In July 2017, he told <a href=#>The Breakfast Club</a> that he hadn't signed any women to his Maybach Music Group record label because he'd eventually want to have sex with them. "You know, I never did it because I always thought, like, I would end up f***ing a female rapper and f***ing the business up," Ross said. "I'm so focused on my business. I just, I gotta be honest with you. You know, she looking good. I'm spending so much money on her photo shoots. I gotta f*** a couple times." Ew. The rapper later apologized for his comments in a <a href=#>Facebook</a> post promoting his Signed show.</p><p dir=ltr>Clearly, Ross' failed Signed competition didn't help his case. In another <a href=#>viral clip</a>, the "Diced Pineapples" crooner implied that he gave Just Brittany special treatment because he found her attractive: "I showed [Brittany] a little extra love ... Of course, I had a fun time with her. I was flirting with her, but at the end of the day, I wanted to see her win."</p><p dir=ltr>Just Brittany also spoke out on the controversial clip on a Jan. 24, 2021 <a href=#>Instagram</a> post: "I'm happy this video is making its rounds and I want to say that colorism definitely plays a role in lighter skinned women, like myself, having more access in the industry. Kaiya is extremely talented and I wish darker women were seen more."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbGpgboR0e9OhnGasoqrBqXnAm6aurF2ptaZ50aKapGWipMC0ecKopa2qn6uys7%2FYZquhmaRitrR5066pp6GenHqpscCdqmg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./microsoft-springs-a-surface-launch-surface-laptop-4-announced-with-custom-ryzen.html><span>←</span><span>Surface Laptop 4 Announced With Custom Ryzen</span></a>
