My three main criteria for yoga pants still prove necessary in my search for flare leggings today. First off, I need pockets for running errands so I don’t have to bring a purse. Secondly, they can’t be see-through, especially upon bending over (I shudder remembering a pair that once revealed everything). And finally, I ideally want a pair that provides tummy control.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After hours of searching and reading what felt like hundreds of reviews, I finally found an Amazon best-seller that checked off all my boxes: the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">FireSwan Crossover Flare Leggings</a>. Better yet? These leggings are on sale for only $23, and with over 3,300 five-star ratings, I immediately added them to my cart.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-fireswan-crossover-flare-leggings></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>FireSwan Crossover Flare Leggings</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Amazon</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">These yoga pants have that flare-leg style I was after,&nbsp; but also come in <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">capri-length</a> and <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">split-leg options</a>. Most of the 19 colors feature a flattering V-waistband, though straight, <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">high-waist styles</a> are also available —&nbsp;both with deep and functional double pockets on both hips. The Spandex-blend material is incredibly stretchy and compressive without being too restrictive, and sizes range from X-Small to XX-Large.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When I first tried these flare leggings, I was honestly surprised at their quality, given how buttery-smooth they felt. The criss-cross waistband cinched in my waist and gave me an incredibly flattering figure. They even got the stamp of approval from my friend who, upon seeing me in the leggings, complimented how great my butt looked. Last but not least, the pockets easily held my iPhone without risk of it falling out, which was helpful for a day of running errands in the city without having to bring a purse.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I’ve been wearing these leggings for the past month and they’ve held up nicely without stretching out, even after multiple washes. I love how comfy and nonrestrictive these leggings are, so much that I even wore them on a cross-country flight from New York City to California last weekend.I also wore them on a hike and was impressed by how breathable and stretchy the material was.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hundreds of reviewers shared similar sentiments, with <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">one person</a> raving how “the leggings are so incredibly buttery soft, so flattering, and so easy to wear with anything.” <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">A reviewer</a> confessed they’re “about to buy another pair” now that their first has become their “favorite pants” and <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">a final shopper</a> said the leggings were “100-percent squat-proof.” A number of reviewers were also extremely excited about the pockets, with <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">one stating</a>, “The inclusion of pockets is a game-changer” and <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=5 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">a second person</a> claiming that they “love how the pockets are deep.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re ready to relive the 2000s, <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">grab your own pair</a> for $23 at Amazon while this deal lasts.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Amazon</span></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57xaKpnqunlrtuxc6gmGaokaPBtHnEnaCtp6Jiv6bCyJ6uZpmdlsewuoxrZ2trXW2BcoWTbW0%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gabe-vincent-net-worth-how-much-is-he-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Gabe Vincent Net Worth: How Much Is He Worth?</span></a>
