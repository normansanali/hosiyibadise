If you’re looking for cute pajamas to rock while quarantined and practicing social distancing — look no further! For years, celebrities have actually been wearing chic pajama-inspired looks in public, and they’re perfect for lounging around the house, too. While stars have dressed UP the looks with heels and makeup while wearing them out and about, they can also be worn with slippers and socks to sit back and relax on the couch."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

For years, celebrities have actually been wearing chic pajama-inspired looks in public, and they’re perfect for lounging around the house, too. While stars have dressed UP the looks with heels and makeup while wearing them out and about, they can also be worn with slippers and socks to sit back and relax on the couch. Stars like&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Selena Gomez</a>, Gigi Hadid, Zendaya,</strong> and more have all <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>transformed their PJs</a> into smart streetwear.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2><strong>Kourtney Kardashian</strong> loves this trend and the mother-of-three <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>looked fabulous</a> when she was out to dinner in LA on July 15 rocking an all-black pajama look. She donned a pair of oversized silk Toteme Vizelle Trousers in Black Monogram with the matching loose Toteme Sanville Blouse in Black Monogram. She accessorized with a pair of Gianvito Rossi Calypso Leather Sandals and a black face mask.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/kourtney-kardashian-pajamas-bakcgrid-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>Gigi has tried out this trend on multiple occasions (and looked amazing each time.) The model has worn pajama sets to do everything from casually walking around New York to attend red carpets. One of our favorite takes of hers was when she stepped out in Manhattan in June 2017 wearing a blue and white pinstripe set by Christian Dada. The cute jacket and pants had red details which she expertly matched to her bra and sunglasses. She finished off her look with white&nbsp;Stuart Weitzman booties.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>We also loved the spin <strong>Lily Collins&nbsp;</strong>recently put on the trend. The actress, 30, looked incredible in a burgundy geometric pajama set while attending Deadline‘s Contenders Emmy event in Los Angeles on April 7, 2019. She elevated the <strong>Etro</strong> ensemble by pairing it with black feathered heels.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/selena-gomez-pajama-trend-splashnews-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>But pajamas don’t&nbsp;have to be sets.&nbsp;<strong>Aly Raisman</strong> rocked a sexy, silky, silver jumpsuit <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>inspired by robes</a> when she attended the&nbsp;TIME 100 Gala in April 2018. TBH, we want to live in all of these looks! Head up to the gallery above to see how some of the most stylish stars have rocked pajamas to perfection IRL. Trust me, you’ll definitely want to copy one of these looks – especially on those days when you accidentally sleep through your alarm.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8%2BaoZqlkWLApsDSZqeumpyesG6vxKWcm6qZqbamv4yorK2emanAbrzInKpmqJikwbC%2FjGxscG9gbX5w</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./hold-on.html><span>←</span><span>Kansas - Hold On Lyrics Meaning</span></a>
