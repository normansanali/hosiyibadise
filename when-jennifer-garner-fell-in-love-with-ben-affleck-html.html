I was in college at the time and I didn’t really follow gossip news, so I didn’t even know they had started dating. But still, there, burned in my brain, is the memory of me seeing the news and thinking, <i>Of course</i>. See, I had seen the episode of&nbsp;<i>Dinner for Five</i>&nbsp;(Jon Favreau’s short-lived IFC show where he had actors and directors eat dinner together) that they appeared on together, along with their&nbsp;<i>Daredevil&nbsp;</i>cast members, and I had observed Jennifer Garner fall madly in love with Ben Affleck.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-0ae29a80b8c6eb5e82460b7657d0b9be-2-0-2@published data-word-count=94>The episode aired in January 2003, which means Ben was still dating Jennifer Lopez (Lopez and Affleck had gotten engaged only a couple months prior). Maybe Ben didn’t allow himself to love Garner back, but that didn’t stop her. (As a commenter points out, Garner was still married to Scott Foley. They announced their separation two months after this aired.) I will present&nbsp;you three moments, each better than the next. The whole episode is online, but a lot of it is Kevin Smith talking about stuff that has nothing to do with true love.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-0ae29a80b8c6eb5e82460b7657d0b9be-3-0-0@published data-word-count=89>1. The first moment starts with Ben Affleck talking about how he has a big forehead, which causes Garner to slap her head to show that she also has a giant forehead. This elicits a big smile out of her that Affleck quickly discourages. The conversation continues and Kevin Smith starts making fun of Affleck, which causes Garner (at the 16:10 mark) to want to defend his honor. (Warning: Affleck comes off like kind of a douche. He comes off like kind of a douche throughout the entire episode.)</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-0ae29a80b8c6eb5e82460b7657d0b9be-5-0-0@published data-word-count=49>2. Here Garner talks about how she was cast for the role of Elektra, and thanks Affleck for not making her audition. Right at about 20:09, she gives him such a genuine look of gratitude and affection, it still makes me a bit uncomfortable to see it on television.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-0ae29a80b8c6eb5e82460b7657d0b9be-7-0-0@published data-word-count=73>3. Still, that has nothing on this last look. Are you ready? Affleck is telling the story of going to the Oscars. He tells a joke about how out of place he and Matt Damon felt at the Writers Guild Awards, and BOOM. At the 21:02 mark! This is the exact moment she fell in love with him. This is the image I thought of two years later, when they finally got engaged.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-0ae29a80b8c6eb5e82460b7657d0b9be-9-0-0@published data-word-count=4>Yep, there it is.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/071/72f/383a5cc8d58aa871dd20f9c7c199ab135d-03-jennifer-dinner-for-five-2.h473.w710.jpg alt data-content-img itemprop=contentUrl style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-0ae29a80b8c6eb5e82460b7657d0b9be-11-0-0@published data-word-count=7>The rest is history <a href=#>and hard work</a>.</p><span class=ambrose-short-hed>The Moment Jennifer Garner Fell for Ben Affleck</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57kWlobWdhZXy4tMSnZKOdnqO2p7HRZp6aqp6av26yxKWjZqGeYrmwwsRmrqKsmGKvprqMmp2fpJWYuG%2B006aj</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./grizzy-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-210630-html.html><span>←</span><span>Grizzy Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</span></a>
