It was once the London home of Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother from 1953 until 2002 and was also the home of the Queen and Prince Philip following their marriage in 1947. Today, Clarence House is the official London residence of Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff></figure><p id=eV9yw1skSAHG data-wc=69>Meanwhile, out of all the Queen's children, Anne has been the most successful in leading an independent identity, both as a professional horsewoman and in her charity work.
