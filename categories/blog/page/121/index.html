hello macaron / guest recipe / gluten free
About two years ago, I had this idea that Jack and I could start a food blog together. I thought it would be fun to try new things, and to chronicle our highs and inevitable lows.

Taylor Swift has caused a stir in Kansas City in recent weeks with her star-studded appearances at Arrowhead Stadium to watch boyfriend Travis Kelce in action, but the pop star was already a local hero.&nbsp;
