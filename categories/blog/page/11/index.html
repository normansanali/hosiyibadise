It’s a god-awful small affair
To the girl with the mousy hair
But her mummy is yelling “No”
And her daddy has told her to go
But her friend is nowhere to be seen

And she’s hooked to the silver screen

For she’s lived it ten times or more</article><article class=post-entry><h2>Ellie Jean Winters Leander TX and Ellie Jean Winters car accident</h2><time>Sep 26, 2024</time>
