<a href=../../../../what-do-you-clean-coretec-floors-with-html.html></a>
Answer
Use a broom or vacuum with a hard surface attachment to sweep or vacuum your COREtec flooring. A moist mop is ideal for more thorough cleanings of surfaces. Cleaning materials and chemicals that are too harsh should be avoided. Instead, use a diluted pH neutral cleanser, such as Bona or Hilway, to clean your surfaces.
