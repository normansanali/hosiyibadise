So, I can’t imagine that we won’t go out somehow.” Gary added, “Yeah, I’m sure we’ll get something together and do a proper farewell tour and just love on the fans for a whole year. It’d be awesome!”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Joe’s DUI arrest comes after he <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>welcomed his third child, a baby girl</a> named <strong>Devon Olivia</strong>, with wife <strong>Tiffany Fallon</strong> in December 2020.
