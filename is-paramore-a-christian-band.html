The hit group is back, and their latest album "This Is Why" is a poignant, almost <a href=#>political comment</a> on the current social climate of the world, but sonically it harkens back to all of the elements of their earlier work that fans grew to love over the years.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Longtime fans of Paramore are well aware that the group has come a long way from its humble beginnings in Tennessee. Looking back at the yesteryears of Paramore, some fans are wondering: Are they a <a href=#>Christian</a> band? Well, let's take a look at what "The News" creators have said about their affiliations with organized religion.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Paramore a Christian band?</h2><p>Although Paramore's public image appears anything but religious, the band's members were all brought up Christian, attended church, and have worked some Christian ideologies into their music.</p><p>This has been expressed in various instances over the years. Former member Josh Farro told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Common Revolt</a>, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NME</a>, "Paramore claimed to be a Christian band, and then wrote those lyrics. It contradicts your faith," speaking about their song "Careful," which contains secular lyrics.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Back in 2017, Hayley Williams told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Beats1</a> that she believes faith is the only thing in life that's "bulletproof."</p><p>A few years later, during an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Guardian</a> in 2022, Hayley touched on Paramore's affiliation with Christianity and said that the band members "are all at different stages of unraveling their relationship to faith."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>There are other, more subtle ways that Christianity has seemingly influenced the band members over time. For example, Hayley has a rather large cross tattooed on her thigh.</p><p>On top of that, on physical album inserts for the band's first four records, they thank God in their acknowledgements. Other instances of this include in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">live performances</a> where Hayley sings phrases like "his glory" and "oh father, oh father, oh father, my Jesus."</p><p>All in all, Paramore is not a Christian band by the traditional definition of Christian music. They have made references to Christianity throughout the years and have individually discussed aspects of their relationships with the faith, but Paramore's core directive has never been pushing a Christian agenda.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBuvMCrmKanopp6onnCoamiq6Serq95wZqlnQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-long-do-lash-extensions-last.html><span>←</span><span>How Long Do Lash Extensions Last</span></a>
