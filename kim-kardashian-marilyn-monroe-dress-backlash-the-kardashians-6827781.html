During a chat with her hairstylist Chris Appleton, she revealed that she expected that she'd be criticized for wearing Marilyn's "Happy Birthday Mr. President" dress from 1962, but noted that it was worth the trouble, because she loved the idea of wearing such a legendary gown.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I'm a little nervous some people will hate, and just be like, 'How dare she think she can step into Marilyn's dress,'" Kim said on Thursday's episode of Hulu's&nbsp;The Kardashians. "And I get that."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During her chat, she also explained exactly how it all went down the night of the Met Gala. From start to finish, with her blonde hair and the replica dress and the changing room, Kim detailed everything that had to happen for her to create that red carpet moment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"All of this — this losing weight, dyeing the hair for 30 hours, leaving the hotel in a robe, getting there, changing on the red carpet, just walking to the red carpet, then changing again into a replica of the dress because we can't risk sitting in it and eating dinner," she continued. "Is all for maybe 10 minutes of my life [...] like, that's it."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I love that Marilyn was a normal girl that figured it out and became the most famous woman in the entire world," Kim said during one of the episode's interviews. "It's just fascinating."<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"That sounds like someone we know," a producer later said off-camera. Kim didn't skip a beat when she replied: "Who?"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">She went on to say that it took some convincing to even make the Marilyn dress loan happen. Kardashian explained that many people in the fashion industry still don't "trust" her and that it always takes time for her to convince people to lend her clothes. She added that she needed to somehow make the person who owned the original Marilyn dress believe that she could fit into it.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"No one trusted us; for years, they would never send samples," Kim said last week. "Then, once I would get to Paris and try on the samples, they would be like, 'Oh, wait, she actually fits in our stuff.' So, I don't know how to convince the guy who owns the original Marilyn dress that I'm a shapeshifter."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Designer Bob Mackie was one of the more vocal critics of Kim's decision. Like many Marilyn fans, he said that the dress was designed for the star and not anyone else —&nbsp;and it should maintain that exclusivity.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I thought it was a big mistake," designer Bob Mackie told&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Entertainment Weekly</a>&nbsp;after the Met Gala. "[Marilyn] was a goddess. A crazy goddess, but a goddess. She was just fabulous. Nobody photographs like that. And it was done for her. It was designed for her," he argued. "Nobody else should be seen in that dress."<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57yqKkZqORp7Giv8eimKdlnZa%2FqrjYp2Smp56nvKZ5w6ucrKtdl66kt8uaqqFlpJ2ybrfAq5uaq5ierq%2B%2FjG9va29nbX4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kate-lyn-sheil-tv-actress-net-worth-240565.html><span>←</span><span>Kate Lyn Sheil Net Worth</span></a>
