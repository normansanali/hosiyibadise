I knew that it was possible to do that but I wasn't making a dime. I decided, I'm going to do this. I'm not going to let YouTube go. My agent's going to drop me. And he did. That's when I totally invested 100 percent of my time and my life savings into my channel. I worked on my channel full-time for a year before I started to make money. I just had to live off my savings. I lived in a really small apartment with, like, six people and three bedrooms."</p><p>In 2019, she made an appearance as a guest judge on Netflix original competitive-baking show Nailed It!.</p><p>In 2019, Pansino was admitted to a local hospital after complaining of suffering severe pain and illness.
