In 1948 he moved to Shreveport, <a href=#>Louisiana</a>, and he joined the <i>Louisiana Hayride</i>, a radio show broadcast that propelled him into living rooms all over the southeast appearing on weekend shows. Williams eventually started to host a show on KWKH and started touring across western <a href=#>Louisiana</a> and eastern Texas, always returning on Saturdays for the weekly broadcast of the <i>Hayride</i>. After a few more moderate hits, in 1949 he released his version of the 1922 Cliff Friend & Irving Mills song "Lovesick Blues", made popular by Rex Griffin. Williams' version became a huge country hit; the song stayed at number one on the Billboard charts over four consecutive months, crossing over to mainstream audiences and gaining Williams a place in the Grand Ole Opry. On June 11, 1949, Williams made his debut at the Grand Ole Opry, where he became the first performer to receive six encores. He brought together Bob McNett (guitar), Hillous Butrum (bass), Jerry Rivers (fiddle) and Don Helms (steel guitar) to form the most famous version of the Drifting <a href=#>Cowboys</a>, earning an estimated US$1,000 per show (equivalent to US$10,285.3 in 2018). That year Audrey Williams gave birth to Randall Hank Williams (Hank Williams Jr.). During 1949, he joined the first European tour of the Grand Ole Opry, performing in military bases in <a href=#>England</a>, <a href=#>Germany</a> and the Azores. Williams released seven hit songs after "Lovesick Blues", including "Wedding Bells", "Mind Your Own Business", "You're Gonna Change (Or I'm Gonna Leave)", and "My Bucket's Got a Hole in It".</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmeYlrusedaio6WhkaLAbrrErWSwp6KptW6BlG5naw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./golden-globes-biggest-snubs-surprises-through-the-years.html><span>←</span><span>Golden Globes: Biggest Snubs, Surprises Through the Years</span></a>
