Some people are using that as an excuse to spread hatred against the LGBTQ community.</strong></p><p>Let’s find the truth of the surface picture that claims Salvador is transgender.</p><p>There is no doubt that the recent Texas shooting has grabbed national attention. Many rumors and fake news are spreading about the people involved in the incident and people who have no relationship to the incident.</p><p>There are unwarranted rumors about Salvador being trans and a picture of another person in female attire spreading across the internet. A rumor like this directly affects the LGBTQ community and increases hatred against them.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=salvador-ramoss-sexuality-discussed-after-photos-surface-online></span>Salvador Ramos’s Sexuality Discussed After Photos Surface Online<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>People speculate that Salvador is a trans man because of photos circulating over the internet. Many people believe that the person in the pictures is Salvador, which is not valid.</p><p>The photos that have been circulating are of another person who goes by the name Sam, who is recognized as a transwoman, They have no relationship with the shooting, and their picture has been misused.</p><p>This was also clarified in a&nbsp;Tweet, which is going viral now. People should be cautious before sharing someone’s picture because Sam has been receiving threats and pejorative because of the fake news.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=lgbtq-community-is-afraid-salvadors-sexuality-might-spread-transgender-hate></span>LGBTQ Community Is Afraid Salvador’s Sexuality Might Spread Transgender Hate<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The internet has been swayed by rumors about Salvador being transgender; however, this is an entirely baseless rumor. There is no evidence supporting this, and in the name of evidence, people are circulating images of another transwoman.</p><p>People fear this will increase hate crime in the already vulnerable LGBTQ+ community. People have already started to post several posts expressing their community’s hatred.</p><p>News and the expression of bigotry like this will harm innocent community members, so people should be careful about the information they receive. On top of that, no one should be judged based on one person in the community.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-salvador-trangender-photos-surfaced-online></span>Is Salvador Trangender? Photos Surfaced Online<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Photos of a transwoman have been going viral all over the internet, claiming Salvador to be transgender. However, all of this rumor is false because the picture does not belong to Salvador.</p><p>As of now, no evidence indicates Salvador is transgender. He has been shot to death in the gunshot exchange between him and the police. He has been accused of killing 19 innocent souls.</p><p>More detail about his motive can be expected soon after the police release statement about the incident.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKSXl8GyecKopKatnp7BunnIrGSanqKWtqV50pqjr5mUpL9uvsCmpqxlnZ60qcCMrKernZGZera61pqpq5meqbKledOrmKerl5q7pbHRZp%2BarJVirqfAxKtkoaGjYsCmxNSao6KsqWK2tHnBq6aun5ipeqq606hkqq2VqMGqu81maWg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./king-kong-bundy.html><span>←</span><span>King Kong Bundy Height, Weight, Age, Biography, Wife, Kids &amp;amp; Family</span></a>
