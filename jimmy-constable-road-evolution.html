The singer’s personal experiences are reflected within the songs, with ‘Best A Broken Man Can’ focusing on some of his earlier struggles and dark days, whilst ‘Worth It’ highlights happier times in his life.&nbsp;The album was released yesterday (Friday April 13) and went straight into the top 10 of the country music chart on iTunes.</p><p>In order to create his solo album, Jimmy teamed up with long-time friend and hitmaker John McLaughlin, who wrote and produced many 911 hits in addition to tracks for Busted, Westlife and Five. Jimmy also worked with writer and producer Jud Mahoney, best known for his work with Boyz II Men, Usher and Michael Jackson.</p><p>When working on the album, Jimmy wanted to embrace his passion for country music whilst pushing himself in a new musical direction. After recording a few tracks, he turned to Pledge Music in order to help complete his album. Thanks to the dedication of his loyal fans, Jimmy reached 128% of his Pledge goal and the rest, as they say, is history.</p><p>Speaking about the album, Jimmy said: “I started to get into records by Brett Eldredge, Keith urban, Florida Georgia Line etc. quite a few years back and loved the sound, lyrics and style of these artists. I thought it would be great to write some tracks with John and Jud in this style but to keep a handle on my love of RnB to see how that would work out.”</p><p>“We wrote and recorded 4 or 5 tracks over a few trips to the Boombox Studio in Glasgow and low and behold, they turned out spectacular! This lead to a very successful Pledge campaign to complete my album…and I can’t thank my Pledgers and my loyal fans enough for their love and support of this project.”</p><p>“I’m really proud of these songs and love the fact that they are in a different style than what I’ve been known for. They still have a pop edge but with a more contemporary New-Country feel..and an added RnB flavour which Jud is renowned for! I am so excited and a tad nervous about stepping out on my own but feel the time is right! The tracks are mega and the stars have aligned for me to have a shot on my own and I can’t wait to get out there and perform them!”</p><p><span>Take a listen to&nbsp;Road To Evolution&nbsp;below.</span></p><p>Road To Evolution&nbsp;is also available on <a href=#>iTunes</a>.</p><h4>Let us know your thoughts on Jimmy Constable’s debut solo album on Twitter <a href=#>@CelebMix</a></h4><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51kt6q5zLJknKeeqMGirsueZKunkZl6psLOpaytoZ%2BjfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jerry-buss.html><span>←</span><span>Jerry Buss Wiki, Wikipedia, West Press Conference, Jewish, Second Wife, Net Worth, Children, Cause o</span></a>
