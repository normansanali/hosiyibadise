She quickly earned a reputation as the most over-the-top SLC Housewife, managing to fight with all of her fellow cast members — including her best friend, <a href=#><strong>Heather Gay</strong></a> — in the show’s first season, which aired from November 2020 to February 2021. One of her biggest battles was with <strong>Mary Cosby</strong>, who infamously upset Shah when she told her she “smelled like hospital” after she had visited her aunt. Shah later called Cosby, who is married to her step-grandfather, a “grandpa f—ker.”</p><p>Shah is married to <strong>Sharrieff Shah</strong>, a football coach at the University of Utah, where the pair met during their college days. They share two sons, Sharrieff Jr. and Omar. Raised as a Mormon, Jen converted to Islam after learning about the historical mistreatment of Black people within the Mormon religion.</p><p>Jen owns three businesses — JXA Fashion, Shah Beauty and Shah Lashes — but in March 2021, she was arrested and charged with running a nationwide telemarketing scheme along with one of her assistants, <strong>Stuart Smith</strong>. At her arraignment in April 2021, Shah pleaded not guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering.</p><p>In July 2022, Jen changed her plea to guilty, and in exchange, the charge of conspiracy to commit money laundering was dropped. Judge <strong>Sidney Stein</strong> sentenced her to 78 months in prison in January 2023. On February 17, 2023, Jen reported to FPC Bryan in Texas to begin her sentence.</p><span>More ▾</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOinKxnmpq7br%2FHmp9o</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./is-arne-johnson-alive-today-where-is-he-now-in-2022.html><span>←</span><span>Is Arne Johnson Alive Today?
