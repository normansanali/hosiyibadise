<span>Aldo Pusey</span></p><h1>Kayla Itsines : Biography, Height, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Career</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Kayla Itsines is a well-known personal fitness trainer, author, and entrepreneur from Australia. Kayla Itsines is the internationally renowned author of the ‘Bikini Body Training Guide fitness eBook series, as well as the ‘Sweat with Kayla diet and training app. The app became the most profitable app of 2016. She is a YouTube sensation as well as a well-known social media celebrity.</strong></p><h2><span id=Kayla_Itsines_Net_Worth>Kayla Itsines Net Worth</span></h2><p>Kayla was crowned Fitness Queen in 2016. In terms of income, her app topped all other fitness applications in 2016. Her net worth is believed to be approximately $46 million. Kayla Itsines’ projected net worth as of December 2022 is <strong>$63 million</strong> US dollars.</p><h2><span id=Biography_of_Kayla_Itsines>Biography of Kayla Itsines</span></h2><p>Kayla Itsines was born on <strong>May 21, 1991</strong>, in Adelaide, South Australia, Australia. She will be 30 years old in 2021. Anna Itsines and Jim Itsines were her parents, and she was their elder daughter.</p><p>Her parents both worked as teachers, and her younger sister, Leah Itsines, is a personal trainer and food stylist. Itsines grew up in Australia. Her nationality is Australian, and she is of Greek-Australian heritage. Kayla’s dream job was to be a beauty therapist.</p><p>Basketball was her childhood passion, although she was underweight and unhealthy. A doctor warned Itsines when she was 15 that she might have reproduction troubles due to endometriosis.</p><p>After understanding that her infertility could be solved, Itsiness began working out at a gym. She became obsessed with exercise to the point where she abandoned her primary aim of becoming a beauty therapist. Itsines graduated as a Master Trainer from the Australia Institute of Fitness at the age of 18 after finishing high school in Adelaide.</p><h2><span id=Kayla_Itsines_Boyfriend_Relationship>Kayla Itsines Boyfriend & Relationship</span></h2><p>Kayla and her fiance, Tobi Pearce, have been in a loving relationship since 2013. In December 2018, she and Tobi declared their relationship on Instagram. They claimed that their first child will be born in May of 2019. She gave birth to a daughter, Arna Leia Pearce, not long ago.</p><h2><span id=Height_and_weight_of_Kayla_Itsines>Height and weight of Kayla Itsines</span></h2><p>Kayla is 173cm tall and weighs <strong>121 pounds</strong>. Because she is a fitness trainer, she has an athletic body structure. Kayla has been taking good care of herself.</p><p>Her dimensions are 34-26-35, and she wears a 33B bra. Her eyes are hazel, and she has dark brown hair. Itsines also wears a size 8 shoe.</p><h2><span id=Professional_Career>Professional Career</span></h2><p>Kayla began her profession after graduating from the university by working at an Adelaide women’s gym. She rapidly discovered that her clients’ machine workouts were not yielding adequate results.</p><p>So Kayla created an aerobic fitness program for her clients that focuses mostly on smaller inner thighs, a flatter belly, and toned arms, and her clients liked it.</p><p>Kayla created workouts for working out at home with minimal equipment and space after noticing that her clients preferred working out at home to going to the gym.</p><p>Kayla also started training her sister’s friend who wanted to become in shape so they could play Netball on their high school team. She promoted her new workouts on Instagram by posting photos of her customers before and after they improved.</p><p>Kayla has a supportive life partner who must share her ambition to be a fitness model. She met Tobi Pearce at a gym in 2013. Tobi was pursuing two degrees at the time, one in law and one in business. He was also working as a personal trainer.</p><p>Kayla and Tobi established a Bikini Body Training Company in March 2013, with Kayla serving as director and Tobi serving as CEO. Kayla published the first two ‘Bikini Body Guided’ volumes in January 2014, featuring Itsines’ workout in the first volume and nutrition guidance from Nutrition Professionals Australia dietitians Julie Dundon and Anne Schneyder in the second.</p><p>By the following October, more than a million guides had been downloaded. Her plan was not to increase muscle or lose weight but to achieve a specific look.</p><p>In 2015, Itsines embarked on the ‘Kayla Itsines Bootcamp World Tour,’ to provide lead-free group fitness programs. She performed throughout Australia’s capital cities, as well as New York, Los Angeles, and London. In April of the same year, Kayla appeared in an Apple advertisement for the Apple Watch, showing the product’s heart-rate monitor feature.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Wife, Girlfriend, And Family Of Adam G.
