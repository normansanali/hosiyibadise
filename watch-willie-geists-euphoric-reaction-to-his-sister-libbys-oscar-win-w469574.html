She served as an executive producer for <i>O.J.: Made in America,</i> which nabbed the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.</p><p>“MY. SISTER. JUST. WON. AN. OSCAR!!!!!

As soon as <b>Taraji P. Henson </b>announces the ESPN Films documentary as the winner, Willie starts jumping up and down and screaming along with the rest of the Geist clan. The whole group hugs and claps — even the dog wags his tail excitedly and runs around the coffee table. “Oh my god!” the <i>Morning Joe </i>anchor exclaims.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Although Libby wasn’t on stage to receive the award with director <b>Ezra Edelman</b> and producer <b>Caroline Waterlow</b>, that didn’t stop the Geists from celebrating. “I want to acknowledge that I wouldn’t be standing here tonight if not for two people who aren’t here with us: Ron Goldman and Nicole Brown,” Edelman said while accepting the honor. “This is for them and their families. It is also for others, the victims of police violence, police brutality, racially motivated violence and criminal injustice.”</p><span class=caption></span><p>The almost eight-hour film covers <b>O.J. Simpson</b>’s rise and fall from beloved football star to his infamous trial and acquittal. The true-crime drama snagged the coveted Oscar over well-received documentaries <i>13th</i>, <i>I Am Not Your Negro</i>, <i>Fire at Sea</i> and <i>Life, Animated.</i>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGawmaSYtW7DyKWjop1dnLKqv9OsZJ6toJ28s7XCZqmemZOptrC6jK2mZqCZqHq0tdKtnKtlnJ6vo8XSZqasm5Gneri1zWaubW5paoR1ew%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./tribute-morristown-mourns-martys-reliable-cycle-owner-marty-epstein-69.html><span>←</span><span>Tribute: Morristown Mourns Marty's Reliable Cycle Owner Marty Epstein, 69</span></a>
