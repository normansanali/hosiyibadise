I looked up photos of my body when I was so skinny — it is cringey,” Kourtney, 43, explained during a new episode of Hulu’s <a href=#>The Kardashians</a> on Thursday, October 6.</p><p>The Poosh founder noted that <a href=#>going through IVF changed her body</a>, adding, “My weight — I used to go so much by weight — I used to be 95 pounds. Then 105 became my new normal weight. I am 115.”</p><p>Kourtney, who tied the knot with <a href=#><strong>Travis Barker</strong></a> in May, has previously opened up about <a href=#>her personal ups and downs amid her fertility journey</a>. (The reality star shares Mason, 12, Penelope, 10, and Reign, 7, with ex-boyfriend <a href=#><strong>Scott Disick</strong></a>. Meanwhile, her husband, 46, <a href=#>shares son Landon, 18, and daughter Alabama, 16,</a> with ex-wife <a href=#><strong>Shanna Moakler</strong></a>.)</p><p>“We started an IVF journey, but I stopped. It was a lot. I took a break to just focus on our wedding and getting married,” the TV personality explained to WSJ. Magazine in September.</p><p>Earlier this month, Kourtney admitted <a href=#>she felt “pushed into” doing IVF</a>. “I got to a place where I just felt, like, exactly how timing was everything with me and Travis. I feel — truly — like if it’s meant to be, It’ll happen,” she said on the “Not Skinny But Not Fat” podcast on Tuesday, October 4. “[We have] prayers and hope that God blesses us with the baby.”</p><p>While cameras were rolling, the entrepreneur <a href=#>used the platform to thank Barker for his support.</a></p><p>“The fertility journey, Travis and I, we stay in the moment and just do the steps that we need to do,” she explained in a May episode. “It is nice to hear good news and have some positivity. We love that, but we just wait to hear the final words.”</p><p>Kourtney added: “I am super grateful that Travis is doing this with me. I don’t think I can do this on my own. I just feel like this is something we have to do together. Making a baby together means we have to be on the same page.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>During the new episode of the Hulu series, the <a href=#>Keeping Up With the Kardashian</a> alum discussed her excitement for her future. “I also love being curvier. It is just channeling that queen energy and embracing the woman that I am,” she told cameras during a confessional.</p><p>Scroll down for everything Kourtney shared about her self-life journey:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BgvLa%2B06ecsmWblr%2BlrdKhoJqmXaeyt7HApapmq5iaerixyKCfrGVhZoJuuMGsZJqepJq%2FbrXVn2Sjp6Wnu6bFjg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kaylie-altman.html><span>←</span><span>Kaylie Altman</span></a>
