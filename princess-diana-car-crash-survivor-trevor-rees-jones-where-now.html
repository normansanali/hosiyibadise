However, there was a fourth person in the car who survived the horrific tragedy. Trevor Rees-Jones was bodyguard to Dodi and Diana and was badly injured in the crash. So what does he remember, and where is he now? &nbsp;</p><h2>What happened to Trevor Rees-Jones?&nbsp;</h2><p id=eFcix7ZIMgU data-wc=66>Trevor was the sole survivor of the crash, but was left very badly injured. He was in a coma for ten days and suffered catastrophic facial injuries, including breaking every bone in his face, which was reconstructed with 150 titanium parts by using a photo from before the crash. He spent a month in a hospital in Paris before being able to return to the UK.&nbsp;</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Have you watch The Crown season 6 yet?</figure><p id=e4XHR4etHUS data-wc=76>At the time, the surgeon who reconstructed his face told the BBC that it was "completely smashed [and crushed]." He added: "I have never seen so many fractures on a man who was still alive." Speaking to CNN about his own experience, he said: "I had a tracking tube out of my throat so I couldn’t make any sound… [I] just had to lie there and just absorb it, and that was quite difficult to do."&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><p id=eOwmTg3lOgu data-wc=27>He added: "Anytime I look at the vehicle, it amazes me how anyone got out of there alive, especially myself who was sitting in the front seat."&nbsp;</p><h2>What does Trevor Rees-Jones remember?&nbsp;</h2><p id=e2zDfni76_cL data-wc=43>Trevor has spoken about his lack of memory from the crash, revealing that he could only remember leaving the Ritz, and nothing about the events of the incident, saying: "I’m the only person who can tell people for real, and I can’t remember."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/1004d96a9697-gettyimages-727013459.jpg><p id=enn45l0chfp5 data-wc=94>He told The Guardian: "At the time, I wanted to know. I was desperate to know… If you like, it's 'survivor's guilt'. I thought a while ago it would be a lot less hassle if I wasn't around, and things could have moved on." He added in an interview with 60 Minutes: "If Henri Paul had been driving so fast that it was a security risk, that his driving was—that he couldn’t control the car, that it was going too fast, then I would like to think that I would have said, 'Slow down.'"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7924fe6a3cf2-gettyimages-79185483.jpg><p id=eF50FvrsPobJ data-wc=69>He gave evidence at the inquest, claiming that he had vague memories of Diana saying Dodi’s name and a motorbike driving alongside the car, but admitted that he wasn’t sure if they were real. Speaking about a conspiracy to kill Diana, he said: "I am not part of a conspiracy to suppress the truth at all. All I have ever done is give the truth as I see it."</p><h3 class="factBoxTitleClass_f1xis0ve hm-heading">The Crown season five recap</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/cfe4e23c40eb-the-crown-season-five.png><ul><li><strong>Prince Charles and Princess Diana marriage breakdown</strong></li></ul><p id=e3R8Z3Pw0d>Season five began with Princess Diana devastated that their second honeymoon was halted abruptly by Princes Charles.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>"Queen Victoria Syndrome"</strong></li></ul><p id=e4XkRiVzKJk>Prince Charles met with the Prime Minister after a published poll about the public's opinion of the monarchy.

Speaking about the inquiry, he said: "I'm happy with the investigation's conclusion. I'm happy with what I did that night, and I've moved on from that."</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><h2>Where is Trevor Rees-Jones now?&nbsp;</h2><p id=ehUh5IfuzazG data-wc=59>Trevor now lives in Shropshire after working as a security director for the oil company Halliburton. He has since worked as the head of security for AstraZeneca. He wrote a book detailing his memory of the event in 2000, titled The Bodyguard:s Story: Diana, the Crash, and the Sole Survivor, which helped him purchase a home back in 2000.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/11021b149368-gettyimages-830345200.jpg><p id=edzYZIcv1D3v data-wc=76>Speaking to The Guardian in 2000, he said: "I am more than a car accident. There is more to me than just a car accident," adding: "I am confident in myself of what I did. I am confident that I did as much as I could do in that situation. I've got to look in the mirror every day and be confident with the actions I took that night. And I'm happy to do that now."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5uZ3BuZm58sb7Ip5qeq6NisaqtzZpknJmiYrCzrdKhZKytoqu2t7vRZqurnaakv26%2BxJ6qZqKfo7K0edahnKudXaO8uHs%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-does-a1-mean-in-music.html><span>←</span><span>What does a1 mean in music</span></a>
