It’s important to note you want to avoid talking to Gerringothe before you’re ready to fight them. If you get into range of this boss, a cutscene triggers, where you’ll have a chance to introduce yourself to Gerringothe, but the only thing they request from you is to give them gold. Like the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Malus Thorm</a> and the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Thisobald Thorm</a> battles, there’s a way to end this encounter without any combat.</p><p data-injection=true>Initially, they tell you that you need to pay them gold if you want to pass. Tossing them a piece of gold will have them demanding more gold until your <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Baldur’s Gate 3</a> party realizes that Gerringothe wants every piece of gold you have. <strong>If you refuse to give Gerringothe any type of gold</strong> at the start of the encounter, this triggers a boss fight, and you’ll have to face off against them. Alternatively, you can attempt to drag answers out of Gerringothe.</p><p>I found it was difficult to want to refuse to give Gerringothe any gold when I first encountered this boss with my Baldur’s Gate 3 group. At first, it feels like the best approach to this fight was to end in a battle, but this is typically the worst way to approach it. Instead, it’s all about trying to <strong>trick Gerringothe into listening to your character</strong>, until eventually they provide gold to you. It all comes down to passing Skill Checks.</p><p data-injection=true>This is the alternative path you can explore rather than fighting Gerringothe in Baldur’s Gate 3. Instead, if you can find a way for <strong>Gerringothe to pay you, this automatically defeats her</strong>. I was able to do this with my main character being a Rogue and Monk, but I was also able to do this with Wyll.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Outwiting-Gerringothe-Thorm-in-Baldurs-Gate-3.jpg><p data-injection=true><strong>The trick is to provide Gerringothe with one piece of gold and then ask her what you’ll get in return</strong>. She should reply with, “<strong>You may pass the river. But first you must pay.</strong>” When you reach this point, you need to lean on your character’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Class Persuasion skills</a>, or you can go for a straight Deception that you’re here to replace her as the Toll Collector.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Convincing-Gerringothe-Thorm-in-Baldurs-Gate-3.jpg><p data-injection=true>After convincing Gerringothe you’re there to replace her as the Toll Collector in Baldur’s Gate 3, she’ll hand over her gold, explode, and the fight is over even before it begins. However, this is a more indirect method. There is a way to defeat her in battle, but it requires some setup and a good amount of work.</p><p>I do not recommend fighting against Gerringother Thorm in Baldur’s Gate 3 unless you are prepared for it. Some players may want to do it as a form of a challenge, but I when I did it, I found the process much more overwhelming than enjoyable, and believe it’s far too much of a challenge than the entire encounter could be. You’re better off saving before you talk with Gerringothe, and completing the conversation, rather than beating them in a straight fight.</p><h2 id=1-how-to-defeat-gerringothe-thorm-in-baldurs-gate-3-all-weaknesses>How to Defeat Gerringothe Thorm in Baldur’s Gate 3 – All Weaknesses</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Breaking-Gerringothes-Gold-Armor-in-Baldurs-Gate-3.jpg><p>Instead, rather than directly face off against Gerringothe, bring your party members downstairs, and have them all begin <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sneaking and enter Stealth</a>. You want to use your best Baldur’s Gate 3 character that is effective at Sneaking and performing sneaking attacks, which might mean using your main character or Astarion, depending on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">how you built your party</a>. From there, have your characters systemically defeat the various floating skulls when they stand next to Gerringothe. This will take a lot of careful planning, and timing. This is the best method to knock off the Gold Armor and expose Gerringothe.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Defeating-Gerringothe-in-Baldurs-Gate-3.jpg><p>The goal is to eliminate as many of the skulls in the Tollhouse as they do a large amount of damage to knocking Gerringothe’s armor off. The problem with this is that the creature can hit you with a large amount of damage, and it has a lot of health. <strong>Over 600 health, to be specific</strong>. This is why you’ll want to have all of your Baldur’s Gate 3 characters in Stealth and plan out the best way for the skulls to explode, destroying Gerringothe’s Gold Armor.</p><p data-injection=true><strong>Related</strong>: <a href=#>Baldur’s Gate 3 – Can You Romance Multiple Characters in BG3?</a></p><p>The skulls are extremely tricky to battle. Although they’re the key to defeating Gerringothe, if there are too many on the battlefield, they can easily overwhelm your Baldur’s Gate 3 party, and make short work of your encounter. I encourage you to take out as many of the ones lingering on the outside of the Tollhouse before starting the encounter if you’d prefer to fight Gerringothe in a more direct way.</p><h2 id=2-best-method-to-beat-gerringothe-thorm-in-baldurs-gate-3>Best Method to Beat Gerringothe Thorm in Baldur’s Gate 3</h2><p data-injection=true>Between the two choices, I found that speaking with Gerringothe rather than taking her on in a straight fight was a better option for my Baldur’s Gate 3 campaign. My companions had more chances for Advantages during their Skill Checks, and I found this to be much easier than going into a head-to-head fight against Gerringothe. Plus, the mechanic to get this fight perfect took a good amount more time, and I struggled with it far more than I’d like to admit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.gamepur.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Baldurs-Gate-3-Defeating-Gerringothe-Thorm.jpg><h3>About the author</h3><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/dd39bd735ebf6fbf05d2fe8f91a978f7?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepur.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fcropped-gamepur_favicon-1-192x192.png&r=g2x" height=96 width=96 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Cande Maldonado</h3><p class=author-url></p><p class=author-desc>Though Cande started her journey in the video game industry as a localization specialist six years ago, she soon realized that her true calling was to annoy NPCS, smash virtual pottery, and complete every side quest available in RPGs.
