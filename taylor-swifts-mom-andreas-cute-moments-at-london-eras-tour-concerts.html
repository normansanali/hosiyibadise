You clearly thought this was a good idea [and] you wanted this to happen. Blows me away. I’ll spend forever trying to thank you for that.”</p><p class=p1>Andrea, meanwhile, watched all three London concerts from the VIP tent alongside Taylor’s dad, Scott Swift, and her brother, Austin Swift.

I’m looking at 89,000 people who decided to come hang out with us on the <i>Eras Tour</i>,” she said during her <i>Lover </i>set. “I’m gonna be honest with you: I have my ways of telling, before I even hit the stage, what kind of crowd I’m walking out to see. I’ve got my little spies. By my spies, I mean my parents.”</p><p class=p1>She added, “They’ll kind of wander around and they’ll watch during the opening artists’ sets and they’ll come back, and I gotta tell you, my dad bursts into the dressing room. Bursts in, he says, ‘You don’t understand. You don’t get it. Night 1 was crazy [and] up here, Night 2 up here, [but] Night 3 it’s off the charts, Tay. You’re gonna love them. They’re absolutely insane.’ He’s talking about you, isn’t he?”</p><h3 class=p1><b>Proud of Travis’ <i>Eras Tour </i>Debut</b></h3><p class=p2><span class=s1>When Travis made his debut appearance during Taylor’s show on June 23, eagle-eyed <a href=# rel=noopener><span class=s2>fans</span></a> caught Andrea filming the cameo with her iPhone.
