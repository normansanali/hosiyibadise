Val Demmings, a Democrat trying to unseat Sen. Marco Rubio this fall.</p><figure class="sc-bwzfXH iMoegR"></figure><p><figure class="sc-bwzfXH dist__StackBase-sc-1fnzlkn-6 hNqMww promo full-width"><span class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hlMdWg">Former U.S. Rep.

She said she still cares greatly about Jacksonville, but it’s because of the recent redistricting.</p><p><span role=presentation class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 fMZjuD">Ad</span></p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">“You’re not ever gonna end up with a Democratic person. You have been gerrymandered. We have had a Democratic seat in Duval County for 74 years, and when you look at how Duval has been gerrymandered, now you can’t even get a moderate Republican. You’re going to get a right-wing nut, I hate to tell you,” Brown said. “I’m not in no suicidal mission. I am interested in going back to Congress to make a difference, and it starts with making sure that you use the principles of redistricting — the principles — that should be a law.”</p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF"><i><b>UNCUT: Press the play button below to watch Jim Piggott’s entire sit-down interview with Corrine Brown</b></i></p><figure class="sc-bwzfXH iMoegR"></figure><p><figure class="sc-bwzfXH dist__StackBase-sc-1fnzlkn-6 hNqMww promo full-width"><span class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hlMdWg">Watch News4JAX reporter Jim Piggott’s entire sit-down interview Friday with former U.S. Rep.

She’s a crook. She has always been crooked,” Dave said.</p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">Bobby said, “Hell no Corine Brown is not qualified and a liar.

And I have not spoke with one person that have not had a problem with IRS. Not one. Everybody I talked to have had — it was one. I agreed to it because I didn’t want to go back through another trial and all of that. So it is not like tax and fraud. It was one tax count that I agreed to, to put them behind me and move forward,” Brown said. “And that’s what I’m doing.”</p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">I asked her what she would say to those commenters.</p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">“I wouldn’t say anything to them. Those are not my supporters. I’m talking to my supporters. I’m talking to the people that want me to represent them. I’m talking to the people who called me. I’m talking to the people that want something to happen for them in Washington,” Brown said. “The people that support me, the people who’ve asked me to run, that’s — those are my supporters. So I didn’t just decide to run. I got calls, people saying we don’t have a voice. We need somebody to represent us.”</p><p><span role=presentation class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 fMZjuD">Ad</span></p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF">Brown joins nine other Democrats, five Republicans and two NPA candidates running in the 10th District.</p><p class="sc-bwzfXH dist__TextBase-sc-1fnzlkn-2 hLMqRF"><b>PREVIOUS STORIES: </b><b>Can Corrine Brown run for Congress again?
