Yet, you've probably heard or even sung them as part of the chorus to Aerosmith's hit <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Walk This Way</a> more times than you can count — and perhaps not truly internalized just what was being said and how dirty it actually was.</p><p>The old motto "sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll" has served that music well over the years. The genre has always embraced sex and drugs to the fullest, often casting aside any moral compass when it comes to the former.</p><p>Some of the most popular and acclaimed rock songs of all time contain lyrics — whether we realize it or not — that hint at less than pure intentions. While fans belt out classic songs' catchy choruses, they might be surprised to learn that some of those lyrics' subject matter crosses the line into the realms of sexual assault and pedophilia.</p><p>Even when a song's lyrics aren't superficially eyebrow-raising, a little research into the song's origins can cast these lyrics in an entirely different — and creepy — light.</p><p>See what we mean in this dive into the surprisingly dirty songs from rock's perverse side above.</p><p>Enjoy this article about dirty songs throughout rock history?
