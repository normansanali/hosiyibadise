Will their relationship continue to be close, or will there be a cooling-off period now that they have at least two more seasons together?</p><p data-characters=271 data-current-count=271 data-injectable=false>While the future direction of the show is unclear, one thing is certain: all the main cast members are scheduled to return, including <strong>Jay Hernandez</strong> as Magnum and <strong>Perdita Weeks</strong> as Higgins. The season will also feature regulars <strong>Zachary Knighton</strong>, <strong>Stephen Hill</strong>, and <strong>Tim Kang</strong>.</p><p data-characters=217 data-current-count=488 data-injectable=true>And season five will get a new cast member in the form of <strong>Michael Rady</strong> (who played Dr. Matt Cooper in Chicago Med). His character’s name will be Chris Childs, and he is set to be a recurring presence in season five.</p><p data-characters=438 data-current-count=438 data-injectable=true>With much of the same production team intact, we can expect more of what fans have always loved about the show: car chases, shootouts, and no doubt lots of breaking and entering. But it also likely means that the brilliant camaraderie between the cast will continue. And with episode titles like “NSFW” and “Welcome to Paradise, Now Die!” in the pipeline, we can be sure that Magnum P.I.‘s innate sense of fun will continue.</p><p data-characters=88 data-current-count=88 data-injectable=false>You can expect Hawaii’s favorite P.I. to return to your screen sometime in early 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yurcanrKZloGK2br%2FEmqqopl2btrexjKecsGWRo7FuvsStrKummaO0bq%2FArKtmqpWhsqK%2FxGauoqaUpMRurc2dZLCgkal6tbuMnq%2BpnZOpfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jessica-betts-niency-nash-surprise-wedding.html><span>←</span><span>Jessica Betts Got Married To Niecy Nash</span></a>
