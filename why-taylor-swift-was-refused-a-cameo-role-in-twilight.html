award-winning singer,’ the food bank wrote on Facebook at the time.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>At the time her donation flew under the radar but following her budding romance with one of the city’s beloved NFL stars, her generosity has resurfaced.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘We were quite surprised,’ Sarah Biles, director of communications at the food bank, told The Kansas City Star.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The food bank was asked not to reveal the amount of the contribution but Biles revealed that Swift raising awareness for the cause is just as impactful as the donation itself.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘In total, it’s a significant contribution to hunger relief and it’s so gratifying to see that she’s chosen a cause like this,’ said Biles.</p><p

And she surprised the trucking staff by giving them each a ‘life-changing’ $100,000.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She also paid more than $110,000 to book 197 rooms for one night at the five-star
