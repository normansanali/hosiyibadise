Alabama has finished in the top 20 in scoring defense in all four of Kelly’s seasons with the program and won a national title in 2020.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Sanders, <a href=#>who was named head coach of the program earlier this month</a>, coached at Jackson State for the past three seasons, compiling a 27-5 record. The Pro Football Hall of Famer also led the Tigers to their first undefeated regular season in program history this year.</p><p>The <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Buffaloes</a> finished 2022 with a 1-11 record, their worst season since 2012. Former Colorado coach Karl Dorrell was fired midway through the season in his third year with the team.</p><h2>What Kelly brings to the Buffaloes</h2><p>Charles Kelly brings Colorado a wealth of experience including stops at powerhouse programs like Alabama. He’s known as an excellent recruiter, and it’s a reputation well-earned. He’s been a defensive coordinator before in the Power 5, including at Florida State.</p><p>He was a valued member of the Crimson Tide’s staff, but it’s doubtful that he would have had the opportunity to be DC with the Tide. He’ll bring that knowledge of recruiting the Southeast to Prime’s staff. It should be viewed as a great hire. — Suttles</p><h2>Colorado’s full 2023 coaching staff</h2><p lang=en dir=ltr>Deion Sanders announces nine of his 10 Colorado assistants, including OC Sean Lewis and DC Charles Kelly.</p><p>Also Tim Brewster on tight ends and Dennis Thurman as director of quality control defense. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/pijf9ZFVPi</a></p><p>— Chris Vannini (@ChrisVannini) <a href=#>December 21, 2022</a></p><h2>Required reading</h2><p>(Photo: Michael Wade / Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57knJvaWxpa3xzfJFrZmpqX2d9cK%2FOpaarmZSkeqK4wJuYppldmLWivsueqmajlaG5unnDnp2epqOew6Z5wqimq5yZo661u9Fo</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-are-the-green-navi-in-avatar-the-way-of-water.html><span>←</span><span>Who are the green Navi in Avatar: The Way of Water?</span></a>
