The government of the town of 12,000 people in the Värmland region of Western Sweden posted about their discovery online, calling on the owner to claim their lost property.</p><p>“We got a phone call from a resident who was visiting Blinkenbergs park,” said Nathalie Andersson, a representative of the Hagfors Municipal government. “[The resident]&nbsp;explained there was a really huge penis sitting on a tree in the middle of the park. Our employees in the area went straight to the place to investigate, and sure enough, there it was.”</p><p>She went on to note that it was, “Over a meter long, and very well made.”</p><p>Oddly, this is not the first time the small town has encountered wooden penises on the streets of Hagfors. Someone, or a group of people, have been leaving these carvings around the town for quite some time. They have been found in the nearby forest, and at local swimming pools.</p><p>Andersson said, “All the penises are very well made, and the people or person who makes them has been putting a lot of effort into it. Sometimes they’re lacquered, sometimes painted.”</p><p>However, she explains, “It’s not the first wooden penis we’ve found, but it’s absolutely the biggest.”</p><p>The local authorities are now looking for the artist who created this carved penis so they can return the property.</p><p>“We’re still looking for the owner,” said Andersson. “It would be great to meet the person behind this creative piece of art.”</p><p>Next, read about the Swedish man who was the first ever to die from <a href=#>penis enlargement surgery</a>.
