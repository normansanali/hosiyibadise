<span>Jenniffer Sheldon</span></p><h1>Annie Lennox Thinks Madonna's Topless Shoot Is &amp;quot;Attention-Seeking&amp;quot;</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Annie Lennox</strong> is a little wary of the ways in which <strong><a href=#>Madonna</a></strong> is choosing to express herself lately. After the Material Girl's <a href=#>topless photo shoot</a> for Interview magazine was released on Monday, Dec. 1, the "No More I Love You's" singer appeared on ITV's Loose Women, where she questioned what Madonna hoped to accomplish with the racy pics.&nbsp;</p><p>Lennox, 59, who was on the Dec. 2 show to promote her new album, Nostalgia, is no stranger to skimpy outfits — remember that red bra? — but says she never took it as far as the Queen of Pop. "I did get things off occasionally, but not to that extent," she argued on Loose Women (via the <a href=#>Daily Mail</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>"I don't think it's down to me [to judge Madonna]…" she continued. "I think the verdict is probably out. Would you not agree on that one? I think the question is, 'What is Madonna telling us?' Anybody know?"&nbsp;</p><p>Panelist <strong>Janet Street-Porter</strong> then volunteered her thoughts, saying, "I think it's attention-seeking." And Lennox — who came to fame around the same time as Madonna in the 1980s — agreed. "I think it is," she noted.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>This is not the first time the former Eurythmics singer has taken issue with the current state of the music industry. Back in September, she called out young pop stars for their sexed-up onstage antics.</p><p>"I think for many it's very convenient and it looks great and it looks radical, but I have some issues with it…I think it's a cheap shot. I think what they do with it is cheap and…yeah. What can I tell you?" she told Pride Source. "Sex always sells. And there's nothing wrong with sex selling, but it depends on your audience. If they're 7-year-old kids, I have issues with it."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJinppmaeq2xzaemsWWknbavt9JmpJqcn6O7or%2BMraappJWowG6%2Fx6imrWWZqHqiwNOepa2hn6N6tLHEpKCnn11nfXKAkmppaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./abby-dowse-body-career-boyfriend-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Abby Dowse Body, Career, Boyfriend &amp;amp; Net Worth</span></a>
