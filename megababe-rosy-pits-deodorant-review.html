Some have been OK, a few have been horrible, and most have been good; but only one has been great — and it's none other than <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Megababe's Rosy Pits</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-aluminum-free-deodorant></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_4-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Is Aluminum-Free Deodorant?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Many people are under the impression that anything that you roll under your arms is a deodorant. However, only antiperspirants actually block sweat from secreting onto the skin by using aluminum salts.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Deodorants, on the other hand, allow your body to just do its thing — at least when it comes to perspiration.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Deodorants are products that mask or neutralize unwanted underarm odor while still allowing your body to sweat," Krupa Koestline, a clean cosmetic chemist and founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="noreferrer noopener">KKT Consultants</a>, previously told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>InStyle</a>. "Typical deodorizers include magnesium hydroxide and plant essential oils like tea tree oil, eucalyptus, and sage, and natural fragrances to neutralize odor. Some have natural antibacterial ingredients like saccharomyces ferment, a yeast ferment with probiotic enzymes, tea tree oil, and coconut oil to help reduce these odor-causing bacteria."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In the case of Megababe's Rosy Pits, the formula includes a mix of coconut oil, green tea extract, and sage leaf to help combat funk.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-benefits-of-using-an-aluminum-free-deodorant></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Benefits of Using an Aluminum-Free Deodorant</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While it's up to you to use whichever deodorant or antiperspirant is right for you, aluminum has become a controversial ingredient over the past few decades. While the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>American Cancer Society</a> has attested for years that studies have shown there is no link between antiperspirant use and the development of breast cancer, many consumers still prefer to use a clean formula.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On top of that, several deodorant sticks these days also offer skincare benefits, along with odor protection. And you can forget about that weird yellow stain aluminum-formulas leave behind on your clothes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: An Expert's Guide to Finding Your Signature Scent</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-expect-when-using-megababes-rosy-pits></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Expect When Using Megababe's Rosy Pits</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">By now, it's pretty obvious that this deo won't prevent you from sweating. However, the delicious scent will likely mask anything coming from your pits.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While my underarms are mostly dry these days and rarely, if ever, let off BO thanks to two Miradry treatments, I actually used Megababe way before I ever got Miradry — and it was one of the few natural deodorants I felt actually did enough to mask the scent of my sweat. Now, it's like an addition to my perfume and keeps my underarms feeling smooth and soft.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, it is important to keep in mind that everyone's body chemistry is a little different. So while I do love this product, it may not be everyone's cup of tea. But it is an award-winning formula for a reason.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-the-final-takeaway></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>The Final Takeaway</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">I have gone through dozens of natural deodorants over the years trying to find "the one." And while I didn't mind a lot of them, Rosy Pits is the only product I've tried that checks all the boxes. No irritation, no redness, no white residue, no annoying scent — no anything that would turn me off.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Plus, while I am generally a fan of clean or linen scents when it comes to body care, I really cannot get enough of the subtle rose fragrance. It feels very personal, sexy, and feminine — which may be a weird way to describe a deodorant, but Megababe's Rosy Pits is truly in a league of its own.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From non-toxic makeup and skincare to sustainability practices, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Clean Slate</a> is an exploration of all things in the green beauty space. Find out what's really in your products — and what's being left out.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZL2zu8Oumq2rXam8sLjSaKSen5GXrqOxjKumrLFdpba1v4ydnKicn6eur8CMq5yvoZWs</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./whats-at-the-bottom-of-the-hudson-river.html><span>←</span><span>Whats at the bottom of the Hudson River?
