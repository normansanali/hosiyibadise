The CGI is unconvincing, the jokes are cringeworthy, the set pieces are perfunctory, and it’s about as derivative and uninspired as its central concept could possibly hope to be; but dammit, it’s Arnold, so it gets a pass.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/FUBAR-3.jpg><p data-characters=456 data-current-count=756 data-injectable=true>That’s a feeling clearly being shared by subscribers all over the world, seeing as FUBAR has shrugged off lukewarm reviews and an underwhelming response from audiences to debut as the platform’s number one episodic effort on a global scale. Per <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">FlixPatrol</a>, the spiritual successor to True Lies <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">in everything but quality </a>has snagged the top spot in an impressive 64 countries around the world, but the big question is how long it can stay there.</p><p data-characters=351 data-current-count=351 data-injectable=false>It’s not a spoiler to say that FUBAR ends with a blatant setup for a second season, so the pressure is on Schwarzenegger’s hefty shoulders to ensure that his name and his name alone are enough to guarantee a renewal for something that wouldn’t be faring anywhere near as well as it currently is with anybody else in front-and-center.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yvsdOfo6Kwo2K5osDErKtmr5mhsa3FjK6loqWRnLavrdOirZ5lkaOxbrzAoqWfrZyhxm6vy6KaoZ2UYryztcaipZqkXZfCrbjDqLGeq12ptaZ5kGaqqaekYraveZVtZJynpaPBs7XErGY%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./matthew-tyler-vorce.html><span>←</span><span>Matthew Tyler Vorce Height, Weight, Age, Girlfriend, Biography, Facts</span></a>
