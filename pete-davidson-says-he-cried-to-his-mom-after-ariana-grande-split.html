One month after their split, Grande <a href=#>released the breakup anthem “Thank U, Next.”</a> She name-dropped Davidson and her other ex-boyfriends in the tune, which the comedian spoke about on Monday night.</p><p>Davidson noted that most artists opt to not name their exes in songs. “Not this wonderful lady,” he joked. “This diabolical genius named all of us.”</p><p>The song premiered just 30 minutes before he had to take the stage for Saturday Night Live on November 3. He noted that he told his friends, “We all have to listen to this song and you all have to look at me,” and “it’s gonna be rough,” though they all admitted the song was “catchy.”</p><p>As for Grande’s NSFW comments about the size of his manhood in the “Thank U, Next” video? Davidson teased that he thinks she just has really tiny hands.</p><p>The New York native’s stand-up comes just a little over three weeks after <a href=#>he posted an alarming message to Instagram</a>, prompting Grande to head to the SNL studios to check on him. “I really don’t want to be on this earth anymore,” he wrote in December. “I’m doing my best to stay here for you but i actually don’t know how much longer i can last. all i’ve ever tried to do was help people. just remember i told you so.” However, a source told Us Weekly&nbsp;that <a href=#>Davidson refused to see Grande</a>. The NYPD conducted a wellness check on Davidson at the time.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Prior to the incident, Davidson <a href=#>opened up about the bullying</a> he’s endured following the former couple’s split. “I’ve kept my mouth shut. Never mentioned any names, never said a word about anyone or anything,” he wrote via Instagram on December 3. “I’m trying to understand how when something happens to a guy the whole entire world just trashes him without any facts or frame of reference. Especially in today’s climate where everybody loves to be offended and upset it truly is mind boggling.”</p><p><a href=#>Davidson is starting off the new year on a positive note, though. </a>A source recently told Us that he’s “doing a lot better” following the past few months.</p><p>With reporting by Jill Webb</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGapnaSaeqWt1aKbrKeeYsCixdJmn55lk6e2prCMraZmoJmoeq67zGaYn6yVp3qivsiapZpll6eur7DEZqqppJmpfA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mikhail-khodorkovsky-net-worth-275108.html><span>←</span><span>Mikhail Khodorkovsky Net Worth</span></a>
